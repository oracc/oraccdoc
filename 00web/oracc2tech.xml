  <p>Oracc II is an update of Oracc with several goals:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Re-implement core Oracc components that are presently written in Perl in C</li>
    <li>Improve processing capacity and performance for large projects such as ePSD</li>
    <li>Improve support for sign lists, both the system-wide sign lists and corpus-based sign lists</li>
  </ul>

  <p>These pages provide notes about the implementation and features
  of Oracc II. They are primarily intended for advanced users and
  programmers who are working with the Oracc UI or Oracc data.</p>
