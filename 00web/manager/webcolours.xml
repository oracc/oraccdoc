<p class="firstpara">Colourization of the pager display on your project's website is facilitated by a simple
configuration file and a special rebuild option. This page describes how to set and change those colours.</p>



<p>The colours of your project website are given in the file <code>00lib/p3colours.txt</code>, which you can open and edit with <esp:link page="emacs">Emacs</esp:link>. You can update the colours any time you change
the colour configuration simply by <esp:link page="the-oracc-command">saying</esp:link>:</p>

<pre class="cookbook">
oracc colours</pre>

<p>Then you need to reload the page you are viewing in your
browser.</p>

<p>Colour specification for regions is always done in pairs, with both
text/foreground (<code>-fg</code>) and background (<code>-bg</code>)
elements being required.  Border colours are given as singletons.</p>

<p>Colours must be specified using the HTML/CSS notation of a hash
mark followed by three or six hexadecimal digits.  In this scheme,
<code>#fff</code> (or <code>#ffffff</code>) is white;
<code>#000</code> (or <code>#000000</code>) is black.  There are
several color maps and wheels on the web, of which one of the nicer
examples is <esp:link url="http://ficml.org/jemimap/style/color/wheel.html">Jemima
Pereira's</esp:link> which is also locally cached on <esp:link url="~/downloads/manager/jemimap/wheel.html">the
Oracc server</esp:link>.</p>

<p>Because colour specification is really separate from the rest of
the configuration process it is handled with a separate file which has
its own format.  The file <code>00lib/p3colours.txt</code> is a
text file with the following format:</p>

<pre class="example">#COLOUR (OPTIONAL NAME) OPTIONS</pre>

<p>This allows options using the same colour to be specified together.
In this format, the <code>#COLOUR</code> is a colour code as described
above.  The <code>OPTIONAL NAME</code> in parentheses is a way for
humans to keep track of the colour the colour code refers to.  No
validation is done on the name, which may come from one of the
standard lists or be made up for the convenience of the creator of the
colours file.  The options are as given below: all of the options in
the paragraph are set to the colour code.  A new colour code at the
beginning of a line starts a new paragraph.</p>

<p>Here is a sample colours file, the one for the CAMS project:</p>

<pre class="cookbook">
#000 (black) lemm-unvisited-fg lemm-visited-fg
#fff (white) logo-fg alt-fg logo-visited-fg logo-unvisited-fg 
     lemm-unvisited-bg lemm-visited-bg h3-bg
#a0b7e0 (pastel blue) banner-fg logo-hover-fg
#1d33a8 (royal blue) logo-bg banner-bg
#df1a1a (scarlet) banner-border other-border
#dbbf3e (mustard) alt-bg
#011f5b (dark blue) logo-hover-bg h3-fg
</pre>

<dl>
<dt>logo-fg logo-bg</dt>
<dd>Colours for the logo patch in the top left corner of the pager display.</dd>

<dt>banner-fg banner-bg</dt>
<dd>Colours for the banner across the top of the pager
display. Defaults to the same as the logo colours.</dd>

<dt>banner-borders</dt>
<dd>Colour for the banner borders.</dd>

<dt>other-borders</dt>
<dd>Colour for all borders except the banner.</dd>

<dt>alt-fg alt-bg</dt>
<dd>Alternative colours which are used for example in the headings the
pager uses for text titles and for the outline-based headings that
come between lists of paged items and references.</dd>

<dt>h3-fg h3-bg</dt>
<dd>Colours for HTML H3 headings; presently only used in the metadata
panel of a text display.</dd>
</dl>

<esp:sh>Link Colours</esp:sh>

<p>Links may involve six colour specifications because they have
foreground and background for unvisited, visited and hover states.
Each link set name described below thus expands to six options, formed
on the pattern <code class="example">NAME-STATE-FGBG</code>.  The name
<code>logo</code> implies the existence of <code class="cookbook">logo-unvisited-bg logo-unvisited-fg logo-visited-bg
logo-visited-fg logo-hover-bg logo-hover-fg</code>.</p>

<dl>
<dt>logo</dt>
<dd>Links in the logo.</dd>

<dt>banner</dt>
<dd>Links in the banner.</dd>

<dt>alt</dt>
<dd>Links when the background is the alternative colour.</dd>

<dt>lemm</dt>
<dd>Links from lemmatized words in texts.</dd>

<dt>score</dt>
<dd>Links from the numbers in a composite text to the score blocks.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Projects can exert additional control over the web display by
providing files <code>00web/project.css</code> and <code>00web/project.js</code>. Both files are loaded last in the HTML header.</p>
