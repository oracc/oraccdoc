<esp:title>Project files</esp:title>
<html><head/><body>

<p class="firstpara">The files belonging to a project are organized according to a specific
set of conventions which are described here.</p>

<p><esp:link bookmark="h_background">Background</esp:link> | <esp:link bookmark="h_projecthome">Project home</esp:link> | <esp:link bookmark="h_editingdata">Editing data</esp:link> | <esp:link bookmark="h_generatingdata">Generating data</esp:link> | <esp:link bookmark="h_publicdata">Public data</esp:link> | <esp:link bookmark="h_subprojects">Subprojects</esp:link></p>

<esp:h>Background</esp:h>

<p>The files belonging to a project are strictly organized; no files
may be present in the project's home directory except system
configuration files (these generally begin with a period
(<code>.</code>) and so are not normally visible when listing the
project home directory.  Several groups of directories contain static
and computer-generated project content, and all of these begin with
digits.  Any directory whose name does not begin with digits is by
definition a sub-project.</p>

<esp:h>Project Home</esp:h>

<p>Most project workers will access project files from the project
home directory.  Thus, when we refer to a
directory <code>00atf</code>, that would be accessed via Emacs using
tramp as: <code>/PROJECT@oracc.museum.upenn.edu/00atf</code>,
where <code>PROJECT</code> would be replaced by the actual project
name.</p>

<p>The programs behind Oracc, however, access project files is from
the top-level Oracc installation
directory.  This matters to you because when a program refers to,
e.g., the
<code>00atf</code> directory in an error message, it will probably
call it something like
<code class="example">/usr/local/oracc/PROJECT/00atf</code>.</p>

<p>This access route is the reason why project names must all be four
characters or more in length: Oracc reserves names of three or less
letters for system files and directories.</p>

<p>This is also the reason why project names must be in all lowercase:
for simplicity and predictability all Oracc directory names consist
only of lowercase letters, in some cases prefixed by a sequence of
digits.</p>

<esp:h>Editing Data</esp:h>

<p>All project content which can be edited by hand is contained in one of the directories
prefixed with <code>00</code>.  The current set of these directories is:</p>

<dl>
<dt>00any</dt>
<dd>conventional space where arbitrary project materials may be 
kept; by convention a subdirectory '00any/portal' contains a copy
of any project portal, which may be a compressed archive.  This copy
of the portal is not used in any way, but is simply a convenient way
to ensure that the portal and the project can be archived together.</dd>

<dt>00atf</dt>
<dd>source texts in ATF format; this is versioned, and ideally each ATF file is in its own
file named by its P/Q/X ID</dd>

<dt>00bak</dt>
<dd>project backups can be stored here, and when the glossary-merger updates a glossary
a copy is made in this directory</dd>

<dt>00bib</dt>
<dd>project bibliography can be kept here, but it is not yet used by the Oracc build
mechanism</dd>

<dt>00bin</dt>
<dd>executable versions of any programs specific to the project should be kept here
(sources should be kept in <code>00any/src</code>)</dd>

<dt>00cat</dt>
<dd>if a project maintains its own catalogues the installable sources live in <code>00cat</code>;
note that projects which use the CDLI main catalogue directly have their metadata created
dynamically when the project is built, and do not have any catalogue files in the 00-tree</dd>

<dt>00lib</dt>
<dd>project configuration data, glossaries and signlists live in <code>00lib</code>; text lists
live in <code>00lib/lists</code></dd>

<dt>00map</dt>
<dd>to support the transition to Oracc's new architecture, ATF sources may be accessed
through alternate names via the <code>00map</code> directory which contains links to the
files in <code>00atf</code> in a more user-friendly format</dd>

<dt>00res</dt>
<dd>static content for the project's ESP portal website should be placed here and is migrated into the HTML version of the project along with the automatically generated HTML version of project data; there are separate subdirectories for <code>00res/images</code> and <code>00res/downloads</code> respectively</dd>
<dt>00tei</dt>
<dd>additional TEI data can be placed here and is migrated into the XML version
of the project along with the automatically generated TEI version of project data.</dd>

<dt>00web</dt>
<dd>editable project content for the ESP portal website should be placed here and is migrated into the
HTML version of the project along with the automatically generated HTML version of project
data; images and non-editable downloads live in <code>00res/images</code> and <code>00res/downloads</code> respectively</dd>

<dt>00xml</dt>
<dd>additional project data in XML format should be placed here and
is migrated into the XML version of the project</dd>
</dl>


<esp:h>Generating Data</esp:h>

<p>During the build process, a number of XML versions of the
text-based sources are generated, and these are placed in the
directory <code>01bld</code>.  Each text has its own directory
in <code>01bld</code>, named according to its ID.  When one project
borrows data from another via proxying, it is this ID-named directory
from which the proxied data is taken.</p>
<p>Unmerged glossary data harvested from ATF files is stored in <code>01bld/new/[LANGUAGE].new</code>.</p>

<p>There is also a working directory named <code>01tmp</code>.</p>

<p>Both of these directories actually live in the variable part of the
filesystem, by convention in /var/local/oracc.  The entries in the project
home directory are links.</p>


<esp:h>Public Data</esp:h>

<p>There are several different kinds of public data besides the raw build results.
Like <code>01bld</code> these directories are also links to the Oracc directory
<code>/var/local/oracc</code>.</p>

<dl>

<dt>02pub</dt>
<dd>public files which don't belong in 02www or 02xml are put here; these files
are public but are not visible online</dd>

<dt>02www</dt>
<dd>this is the live project web site</dd>

<dt>02xml</dt>
<dd>this is the XML form of the project's data, which is what is loaded into the XML database; 
there is an [ID].xml for each text in the project, including those which are proxied from other 
projects, and the XML versions of glossaries etc., are included with <code>00</code> prefixes
so that they occur first in the project data in a simple sort</dd>
</dl>

<esp:h>Subprojects</esp:h>

<p>Subprojects work exactly like projects; the only difference is that their home directory 
is a project or subproject directory, rather than the home directory of the project.</p>
