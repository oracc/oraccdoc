<esp:title>Project Life Cycle Management</esp:title>
<html><head/><body>

<p class="firstpara">Many projects go through various phases of development: they may
start as personal tools, then get developed as a book, published in
print, and then revised after publication.  Oracc provides several
general facilities for managing this process: cloning, freezing, and
versioning.</p>



<p>Throughout these instructions, substitute <code>proj</code> for the name of your project (e.g, rinap, cams, hbtin).</p>

<esp:h>Cloning</esp:h>

<p>Cloning a project involves copying all of the files into another
project, changing embedded project names as appropriate.  In
cloning, the destination project must already exist and is normally
created as a subproject before cloning.  The command to clone a
project is simply: <code class="example">oracc clone
[DESTPROJ]</code>, where <code>[DESTPROJ]</code> is the name of the
clone.</p>

<p>So, if you have a project <code>nbtexts</code>, with a subproject
named <code>nb100</code>, for example, which is published as a book,
you might create a subproject <code>thebook</code> and clone
<code>nb100</code> like this:</p>

<pre class="cookbook">
cd nb100
oracc subproject thebook '100 Neo-Babylonian Texts, 1st Edition'
oracc clone thebook
oracc rebuild
</pre>

<p>After this, you can access the cloned project as you would expect,
via the URL
<code>http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/nbtexts/nb100/thebook</code>.</p>

<esp:sh>Limitations</esp:sh>

<p>The initial implementation of cloning does correct <code>#atf:
project</code> lines, and similar constructs in the glossaries.  It
also uses the subproject naming from the clone's config.xml, merging
that with the options from the source project's config.xml.</p>

<p>The initial implementation does not modify HTML <code>title</code>
tags, or attempt to guess where it would be useful to add the version
number to document headings.  Nor does it correct URLs--though this is
not a problem if the source project uses relative URLs.</p>

<esp:h>Freezing</esp:h>

<p>So far, so good, but how do you protect the new cloned project from
being modified or rebuilt?  The answer is to freeze it:</p>

<pre class="cookbook">
cd nb100/thebook
oracc freeze
</pre>

<p>This changes permissions on the user-modifiable parts of the
project (the directories starting with <code>00</code>) so that any
attempt to modify them or rebuild the project will be invalid.</p>

<p>If you mistakenly freeze the wrong project, or you realize you need
to fix some errata in the book, you can unfreeze it like this:</p>

<pre class="cookbook">
cd nb100/thebook
oracc unfreeze
</pre>

<esp:h>Versioning</esp:h>

<p>If you want to keep a snapshot of the project for any
reason--perhaps to have a basis for comparison with the ongoing
development of a work, you can use the command:</p>

<pre class="cookbook">
oracc version
</pre>

<p>This command creates a subproject with a conventional name, clones
the current project into it, rebuilds the subproject, and then freezes
it.  The name starts with the lowercase letter <code>v</code>,
followed by a three digit number.  The number is automatically
computed from existing version directories if any, starting from
<code>v000</code>, so if you have versioned your project twice before,
the new version will be saved as <code>v002</code>.</p>

<p>If you want to edit files after versioning--perhaps to change URLs
in the 00web directory--you can simply unfreeze the project, make the
edits, rebuild it, and freeze it again.</p>
