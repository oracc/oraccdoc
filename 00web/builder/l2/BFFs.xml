<esp:title>BFFs: Byforms</esp:title>
<html><head/><body>

<p class="firstpara">BFFs are the Oracc glossary mechanism for word byforms of various
kinds.  The general mechanism allows the individual byforms to be
treated under their own entries within the glossary and during
lemmatization, but then be kept separate or grouped together when the
glossaries are rendered.</p>



<esp:h>Syntax</esp:h>

<p>BFFs are implemented in glossaries using the <code>@bff</code> tag;
this should be read as 'ByForm-oF', since BFFs are only given under
the entries of byforms, not of the main form.  The choice of main form
depends on the language and the kind of byform.</p>

<p>The <code>@bff</code> tag's syntax consists of two required and two
optional arguments.  The required arguments are:</p>

<dl>
  <dt>CLASS</dt>
  <dd>A single word which indicates which kind of byform this is;
  the names of the classes are language-specific.</dd>

  <dt>OWNER</dt> <dd>A glossary link which must resolve to an
  <code>@entry</code> in the glossary.  Note that the
  <code>@bff</code> linkage points only from the byforms to the main
  form; it is an error for a word named as an OWNER in a
  <code>@bff</code> tag to have its own <code>@bff</code> tags.  The
  link has the same form as other glossary entry links: &lt;CF [GW]
  POS&gt;.  So, to link to ki aŋ, love, the OWNER argument would be:
  &lt;ki aŋ [love] V/t&gt;.</dd>
</dl>

<p>The optional arguments are:</p>


<dl>
  <dt>LABEL</dt>
  <dd>A human-readable label which may be rendered in the glossary
  and is intended to convey information about the byform to
  readers.  This may contain spaces and must be given in double
  quotes.</dd>

  <dt>CODE</dt>
  <dd>A machine-readable code which is stored in the XML version of
  the glossary and is intended for use in machine-processing;
  may not contain spaces.</dd>
</dl>

<p>The required order of arguments (with optional arguments indicated
with a question-mark after them) is:</p>

<pre class="example">@bff CLASS CODE? LABEL? OWNER</pre>

<esp:h>Sumerian BFFs</esp:h>

<esp:sh>Main Forms</esp:sh>

<p>The main forms in Sumerian BFFs depend on the CLASS of the BFF and
are described under Classes below.</p>

<esp:sh>Classes</esp:sh>

<dl>
  <dt>SUPP</dt>
  <dd>Suppletive byform: used for suppletive verbs.  The main form is
  the entry that is used for Perfective/Singular/Subject/Human.</dd>

  <dt>COMP</dt>
  <dd><p>Compound byform: used for collapsed compounds of the type
  <code>mu-un-si-sa₂</code> instead of expected <code>si
  mu-un-sa₂</code>.  With this schema, there is an entry for the
  byform <code>sisa</code> which refers back to the main form <code>si
  sa</code>:</p>

  <pre class="cookbook">
  @entry sisa [set straight] V/t
  @bff COMP &lt;si sa [make straight] V/t&gt;
  @bases si-sa₂
  @form mu-un-si-sa₂ /si-sa₂ #mu.n:~
  @sense V/t set straight
  @end entry</pre>
  
  <p>The main form is the uncollapsed version of the compound.</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>GRAM</dt>
  <dd>Grammatical byform: used primarily for frozen verbal forms
  which exhibit variation in morphological markers.  The main form is
  a matter of choice rather than rule, but should be a widely attested or
  earliest-attested form.</dd>
</dl>

<esp:sh>Labels</esp:sh>

<p>Labels are not used for Sumerian; they are constructed from the CODE argument</p>

<esp:sh>Codes</esp:sh>

<p>Sumerian codes are used only for suppletive verbs.  They are
constructed of hyphen-delimited quadruples giving the following
information, in the following sequence:</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Aspect</dt>
  <dd>P (perfective) or I (imperfective)</dd>
  <dt>Number</dt>
  <dd>Sg (singular) or Pl (plural)</dd>
  <dt>Case</dt>
  <dd>S (subject) or O (object)</dd>
  <dt>Animacy</dt>
  <dd>H (human) or N (nonhuman)</dd>
</dl>

<p>If the selection criterion is not relevant to the suppletion, an
asterisk (*) is used.  Thus, typical suppletion codes include:</p>

<pre class="cookbook">
   P-Sg-*-*

   I-Pl-O-*

   I-Pl-S-N
</pre>
