      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>A super-glossary is a top-level structure which unifies a
      collection of glossaries from other Oracc projects.  The
      super-glossary project maintains its own glossary, which we call
      the <code>base</code> glossary.  Additional glossaries, which we
      call <code>source</code> glossaries, can then be compared to the
      base glossary to identify entries and senses in the source
      glossary which are not in the base.  Resolving these differences
      is called <code>alignment</code>.</p>
      <h2>Alignment</h2>
      <p>Alignment is done via a special file called a
      <code>map</code>.  The map file is generated by the comparison
      routine and is then edited by hand to determine the means of
      aligning each item: they may be added to the base glossary, or
      they may be considered as equivalent to a differently named
      entry, or differently phrased sense.</p>
      <h2>Folders and Files</h2>
      <p>A super-glossary is an Oracc project and organizes its files
      into several conventional named folders (or directories).</p>
      <dl>
	<dt>00bak</dt><dd>Backups</dd>
	<dt>00lib</dt><dd>Configuration file, config.xml, and base
	glossary file, named for the glossary-language with a .glo
	extension, e.g., akk.glo.</dd>
	<dt>00map</dt><dd>Map files</dd>
	<dt>00raw</dt><dd>Raw glossaries ready for induction</dd>
	<dt>00src</dt><dd>Source glossaries and map files, created by
	the superglo tools with conventional names based on the
	project, language and file type</dd>
	<dt>00web</dt><dd>The ESP2 portal and, presently,
	super-glossary documentation</dd>
	<dt>01tmp</dt><dd>Working directory for the tools</dd>
