<esp:title>Using Nammu and Emacs for Oracc work</esp:title>
<html><head/><body>
<p class="firstpara">Nammu is a simple text editor, written especially
for Oracc by <esp:link url="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/research-it-services/research-software-development">UCL's Research Development Software Group</esp:link>, that enables all content creators to edit ATF files, one
file at at time. Use Nammu if your main role in Oracc is to edit texts
for a corpus project. Emacs is a high-powered text editor which, while
not particularly pretty, is extremely useful for editing multiple ATF
files at once,
managing glossaries projects, and writing ESP portals. For now, use
Emacs for activities that involve these tasks. In due course Nammu will gradually
replace all of Emacs functionality.</p>
