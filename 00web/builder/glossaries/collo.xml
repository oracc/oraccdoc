  <html><head/>

<p>The @collo tag gives access to the Ngrammer.  It is normally used with
some convenient shorthands that are defined only for use in
glossaries--where the shorthands can be expanded from context.</p>

<p>When the glossary processor reads 00lib/sux.glo it expands the @collo
rules and puts them in a file, 02pub/collo-sux.ngm.  The lemmatizer
reads these rules and applies them early in the disambiguation
sequence.</p>

<p>When we talk of 'expanding' here, we mean that the shorthand given in
@collo is supplemented with contextual data to create a valid Ngrammer
entry in the output file 02pub/coll-sux.ngm.</p>

<h2>Shorthands</h2>

<dl>
 <dt>-</dt><dd>A simple hyphen indicates the current word: it is expanded to CF[GW]POS</dd>

 <dt>-FORM</dt><dd>A hyphen followed immediately, with no whitespace, indicates the current word but with the specific form in question: it is expanded to :FORM=CF[GW]POS</dd>

 <dt>[SENSE]</dt><dd>A pair of square brackets around a sense indicates that the specified sense of the current word should be selected: it is expanded to CF[GW]POS => CF[GW//SENSE]</dd>

 <dt>POS</dt><dd>A simple Part-of-speech (e.g., PN) indicates that any word with that POS should be considered a match: it is expanded to itself (in fact, it is a standard part of the Ngrammer system, but is mentioned here because of its utility for use in @collo)</dd>

 <dt>SIGNATURE</dt><dd>Any other signature than those described above is simply passed through to the ngram rule that is being built from the @collo</dd>
