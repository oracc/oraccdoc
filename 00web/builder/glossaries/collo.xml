  <html><head/>
  <body>
    
<p>The @collo tag gives access to the Ngrammer.  It is normally used
with some convenient shorthands that are defined only for use in
glossaries--where the shorthands can be expanded from context.  A
typical Ngram entry consists of a Left-Hand Side (LHS) and a
Right-Hand Side (RHS); in <code>@collo</code> entries it's most common
only to give the LHS and let the <code>@collo</code> system generate
the RHS for you.</p>

<p>When the glossary processor reads 00lib/sux.glo it expands the @collo
rules and puts them in a file, 02pub/coll-sux.ngm.  The lemmatizer
reads these rules and applies them early in the disambiguation
sequence.</p>

<p>When we talk of 'expanding' here, we mean that the shorthand given in
@collo is supplemented with contextual data to create a valid Ngrammer
entry in the output file 02pub/coll-sux.ngm.</p>

<h2>Shorthands</h2>

<dl>
 <dt>-</dt><dd>A simple hyphen indicates the current word: it is expanded to CF[GW]POS</dd>

 <dt>-FORM</dt><dd>A hyphen followed immediately, with no whitespace, indicates the current word but with the specific form in question: it is expanded to :FORM=CF[GW]POS</dd>

 <dt>[SENSE]</dt><dd>A pair of square brackets around a sense indicates that the specified sense of the current word should be selected: it is expanded to CF[GW]POS => CF[GW//SENSE]</dd>

 <dt>-FORM[SENSE]</dt><dd>Form and sense can be combined to mean "select this sense of the current word when this form is used"</dd>

 <dt>POS</dt><dd>A simple Part-of-speech (e.g., PN) indicates that any word with that POS should be considered a match: it is expanded to itself (in fact, it is a standard part of the Ngrammer system, but is mentioned here because of its utility for use in @collo)</dd>

 <dt>SIGNATURE</dt><dd>Any other signature than those described above is simply passed through to the ngram rule that is being built from the @collo</dd>
</dl>

<h2>The Ngrammer</h2>

<p>Work-in-progress documentation for the Ngrammer
is <esp:link page="ngrammer">available here</esp:link>. It is
sometimes necessary to give full Ngrammer rules in
a <code>@collo</code> entry, but because the RHS (after
the <code>=></code> is often unnecessary in the Ngrammer it's rarely
necessary to give it in <code>@collo</code>. It is never necessary to
give an RHS consisting entirely of <code>*</code> elements--in fact,
the <code>@collo</code> system discards an RHS that consists entirely
of asterisks.</p>
