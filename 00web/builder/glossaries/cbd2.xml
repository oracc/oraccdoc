<p>This page documents 2022's revised Oracc Corpus-Based Dictionary
(CBD) format code-named CBD2.  This revision corresponds to the
implementation of a new parser for Oracc glossaries (which have the
CBD type).  In the XML version of CBD2 the namespace is
<code>http://oracc.org/ns/cbd/2.0</code>.</p>

<p>There are two major differences between CBD1
(<code>http://oracc.org/ns/cbd/1.0</code>) and CBD2.  One is that in
CBD2 the order of most elements is enforced by the validator.  This
ensures that different glossaries will be structured similarly making
them easier for users to get used to and read quickly.  The other is
greater extensibility--the addition of commands for including
additional files, referencing external URIs, and providing narrative
discussion as well as the data-focussed elements of CBD1.</p>

<p>Most users will interact most of the time with the simple
text-based format of Oracc glossaries, the <code>.glo</code> file.
CBD2 <code>.glo</code>, and the primary purpose of this page is to
document the <code>.glo</code> version of CBD2.</p>

<p>There are also two grammars of CBD2 are available: an XML schema
written in Relax NG's rnc format; and a context-free grammar for the C
language glossary processor, <code>gx</code>, which is written for the
Bison parser generator.  The processor <code>gx</code> reads CBD2
glossaries in the text-format and, amongst other things, exports the
XML version, validating the output against the XML schema as it does
so.</p>

<h2>CBD2 Overview</h2>

<p>CBD2 glossary files consist of a header followed by zero or more
entries.  An entry is structured as a sequence of blocks.  The blocks,
and the common tags which belong to them, are:</p>

<dl>
  <dt>Entry block</dt>
  <dd>@entry @alias @parts</dd>
  <dt>Language block</dt>
  <dd>@bases @form</dd>
  <dt>Senses block</dt>
  <dd>@sense</dd>
  <dt>Meta block</dt>
  <dd>@bib @equiv @inote @isslp @pleiades</dd>
</dl>

<p>In CBD1, the information covered by the meta block could only be
associated with an entry.  In CBD2 there is provision for including a
meta block for each sense.</p>

<h2>Definitions</h2>

<h3>Signature Terminology</h3>

<p>CBD1 and CBD2 both use the terminology of Oracc signatures as
described in <esp:link url="/doc/help/lemmatising/signatures/">the
lemmatisation page on signatures</esp:link>.</p>

<h3>CGP</h3>

<p>We use the abbreviation <code>CGP</code> for a CF-GW-POS
specification of the form <code>a[water]N</code> or <code>a [water]
N</code>.  We refer to the former format as "tight" and the latter as
"loose"--in practice, all software that works with glossaries should
understand "tight" and "loose" formats interchangeably, but in
principle some contexts prescribe that the CGP be in either tight or
loose format.</p>

<h3>CGSPE</h3>

<p>We also use, less often, the abbreviation <code>CGSPE</code> for
CF-GW-SENSE-POS-EPOS. (<code>a[arm//strength]N'N</code>). There is no
loose format for this as it is really a minimal signature.</p>

<h2>The Header</h2>

<p>The common tags in the header are: <code>@project @lang
@name</code>.  In addition, the header may specify the target language
for <code>@sense</code> elements (which defaults to <code>en</code>,
English); describe the CBD version with <code>@cbd</code>, and
reference one or more configuration files for the properties and
relations mechanisms: <code>@proplist @relators</code>.</p>

<p>In the following list, and this document generally, common tags are
described before less common tags.</p>

<dl>
  <dt>@project</dt>
  <dd>The name of the project this glossary belongs to.</dd>
  <dt>@lang</dt>
  <dd>The language for which this is a glossary, i.e., the language of
  the entry headwords.</dd>
  <dt>@name</dt>
  <dd>The name is an informal name for the glossary, usually trivially
  constructed from the project and lang, e.g.,
  <code>epsd2/sux</code>.</dd>
  <dt>@translang</dt>
  <dd>The language of translations in the glossary. Default <code>en</code>.</dd>
  <dt>@cbd</dt>
  <dd>The CBD version: presently only 1.0 and 2.0 are recognized.  Default is 1.0.</dd>
  <dt>@proplist</dt>
  <dd>A file containing configuration information for the Properties
  mechansism; see <esp:link url="/doc/help/glossaries/properties/">the
  properties page</esp:link>. May be given more than once.</dd>
  <dt>@relators</dt>
  <dd>A file containing configuration for the Relations mechanism;
  [[not yet implemented]]. May be given more than once.</dd>
</dl>

<p>In the header, <code>@project @lang @name</code> are required and
must occur first and in that order; <code>@cbd @proplist
@relators @translang</code> must come after the required tags and may be in any
order.</p>

<h2>Entry Block</h2>

<h3>Common Entry Tags</h3>

<p>The entry block is the first part of an entry. An entry begins with
<code>@entry</code> and ends with <code>@end entry</code>.  In
addition, the entry block may contain one or more <code>@alias</code>
tags which give alternate names for the entry.  If the
<code>@entry</code> is for a phrase, the entry block must also contain
a <code>@parts</code> element.</p>

<h3>Rarer Entry Tags</h3>

<p>An entry block may contain a variable tag which gives a DCF, or
<code>Dialect CF</code>--the variable part of this is that a DCF
consists only of capital letters, e.g., <code>@NA</code>, or
<code>@EG</code>.  There are also CBD Edit constructs that are
associated with <code>@entry</code> but use of these is presently
restricted to ePSD.</p>

<h3>Entry Tag Descriptions</h3>

<dl>
  <dt>@entry CGP</dt>
  <dd>An @entry tag is followed by a CGP which must be unique in the
  glossary. The CGP must be given in the loose format.</dd>
  <dt>@alias CGP</dt>
  <dd>An @alias tag is followed by a CGP which may be in either loose
  or tight formats.  The CGP gives an alternate name for the @entry;
  it is not required to exist as a separate entry in the glossary
  because one of the uses of aliases is for the glossary building
  system to include entries from other projects which may use
  different names for words (e.g., Ninurtak[1]DN or
  Ninurta[1]DN).</dd>
  <dt>@parts CGP CGP ...</dt>
  <dd>For compound entries or phrases, one or more @parts entries must
  be given. Each @parts entry is a ordered list of the words (given as
  tight CGPs) that can constitute the phrasal entry.  See the 
  <esp:link url="/doc/help/glossaries/psus/">page on PSUs</esp:link> for
  further discussion.</dd>
  <dt>@[DCF-specification] CF</dt>
  <dd>Oracc glossaries use narrowly defined conventions for CFs.
  Rather than allow different glossaries to use, for example, Old
  Babylonian Akkadian headwords, the glossary must be constructed
  using Oracc's Conventional Akkadian, but Dialect Citation Forms
  (DCFs) can be used to display the headword in the variant form
  online or in print. For example, <code>@entry kalbu [dog] N</code>
  might have a DCF <code>@OB kalbum</code>.  Note that only the CF is
  given with a DCF.</dd>
  <dt>Edit Codes</dt>
  <dd>This section is provided for completeness and can be ignored by
  most users. The edit codes are used by tools which create the
  <esp:link url="/epsd2/oid-history.html">ePSD OID history
  page</esp:link>. An @entry can be preceded by <code>+</code> or
  <code>-</code> meaning that the entry should be added or deleted.
  If the <code>-</code> form is used, there must be a comment
  immediately after the @entry of the form <code>#why: this gives a
  reason for deletion</code>. An @entry can also be followed by an
  entry modifier code.  The single <code>&gt;</code> indicates that
  the entry should be renamed to the CGP after the <code>&gt;</code>.
  The double <code>&gt;&gt;</code> indicates that the entry should be
  merged with the CGP after the <code>&gt;&gt;</code>.</dd>
