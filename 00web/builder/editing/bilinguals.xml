<p class="firstpara">This page describes how to transliterate
  bilinguals using Oracc (the same principles apply to trilinguals,
  etc.).</p>



<esp:h>Overview</esp:h>

<p>Multilingual texts provide special challenges: the text for each
language needs to be processed both on its own and with some level of
alignment (word, line or text), and the layout of the text on the
original artefact is also of interest.  This page provides some initial
guidelines for preferred practices in processing multilinguals in
Oracc.</p>

<esp:h>Layouts</esp:h>

<p>Several layouts are attested in multilinguals:</p>

<ol>
<li>In some cases, words are given as glosses and the translation may
be only partial.</li>

<li>In perhaps the most common case, the translations are given as
interlinear text--typically a tablet of this kind will be ruled in
blocks, with each block containing a pair of lines, the first in, say,
Sumerian, the second in Akkadian.</li>

<li>Another format for multilinguals is to place the translations
alongside each other in columns--this is commonly used in lexical texts.</li>

<li>A variant on the preceding is to bracket one of the languages with
line segments in the other language: so, an Akkadian line may have a
Sumerian translation which is split partly on the left of the Akkadian
and partly on the right.  Words in the Sumerian may themselves be
split by the Akkadian column.  We call these "bracketing translations".</li>

<li>Texts may be given in whole separate passages or on separate
artefacts, as on the Bisitun inscription.</li>
</ol>

<esp:h>Principles</esp:h>

<p>There are several fundamental principles which inform the
recommendations on transliterating multilinguals:</p>

<ol>
<li>It must be possible to recreate the layout of words on the
original artefact</li>
<li>It must be possible to create a running text of each
language-version regardless of the layout of the transliteration</li>
<li>Words <em>within a language version</em> should never be reordered
in the transliteration; it may be acceptable to separate interwoven
language-versions</li>
</ol>

<esp:h>How-to</esp:h>

<p>The examples in this how-to section are keyed to the numbers in the
<esp:link bookmark="h_layouts">Layouts</esp:link> section.</p>

<ol>

<li><p>Use the double-curly bracket notation for translation glosses,
giving the language inside the brackets: <code class="cookbook">iri{{a-li}}</code>.</p></li>

<li><p>For interlinear translations, number each block of lines giving
the various translations of the text as one line, with each
translation given using a <code>==</code> line with the language
switch immediately after the <code>==</code>:</p>

<pre class="cookbook">
2'.	piriŋ abzu-ta me huš šu# ti-a
==%akk	nam-ru ina ap-si-i par-ṣi ez-zu-ti le-qu-u
$	single ruling
</pre>

<p>Be aware that when you lemmatise the text, lemmatisation of the
Sumerian comes immediately after the Sumerian line. Other types of
lines (<code>$, #, #tr:</code>) cannot come between Sumerian and
Akkadian. This means that interlinear translation into a modern
language is not possible in this format.</p>
</li>

<li><p>For bracketing translations, transliterate the text as it
appears on the tablet, separating the different language sections with
a double equals-sign, then the language shift:</p>

<pre class="cookbook">piriŋ abzu-ta ==%akk nam-ru ina ap-si-i par-ṣi ez-zu-ti le-qu-u
==%sux me huš šu# ti-a</pre>

<p>If a word is split between left and right sides, use the ATF
conventions for words split across lines:</p>

<pre class="cookbook">piriŋ abzu-; ==%akk nam-ru ina ap-si-i par-ṣi ez-zu-ti le-qu-u
==%sux -ta me huš šu# ti-a</pre>
</li>

<li><p>For translations of entire texts, or text sections, there are
several strategies.  One is to edit each translated version as a
division of a single composite text (regardless of whether the
versions appear on the same object or not):</p>
