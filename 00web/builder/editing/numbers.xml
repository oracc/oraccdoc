<esp:title>Numbers and Metrology in CDLI Corpora</esp:title>
<html><head/><body>

<p class="firstpara">This page gives basic guidelines for entering numbers and
metrological transliterations for CDLI.</p>



<p> We are preparing an
exhaustive account of numbers and metrology, a preliminary version
of part of which is available for <esp:link url="/doc/downloads/numref.pdf">download
(pdf 120KB)</esp:link>.</p>
      <p>We are aware of the fact that this is a preliminary version and
is restricted to more or less uncontroversial
numerical/metrological systems of the Ur III period; further, that
while restricted, the proposal does include a paradigmatic
completeness, particularly of the smaller units of the systems,
that is not covered by our text corpus. At the same time, complex
fractions of the NINDA2Ã—SIGNS type, and the igi-n-gal2 complex, are
not complete.</p>
      <p>We are thankful for any advice and corrections of mistakes or
omissions you might offer us in this, and subsequent proposals that
will deal with other, and earlier 4th and 3rd millennium
systems.</p>
     
    <esp:h>Transliteration</esp:h>
    
      <p>All numbers are given with digits or a fraction followed by a
qualifier in parenthesis, e.g., 1(disz). A full list of the
allowable forms is given in the reference document.</p>
    
    <esp:sh>Large
Numbers Transliterated According to Their Graphemes</esp:sh>

      <p>Numerical notations are to be transliterated in the form
n(sign1) n(sign2) etc., for instance "3(gesz2) 5(u) 7(disz) gurusz"
for "180 + 50 + 7 workmen" or "6(bur3) 2(esze3) 4(iku) 1/4(iku)"
GAN2" for "6 bur 2 esze 4 1/4 iku field."</p>

    <esp:h>UxKASKAL</esp:h>
   
      <p>Note that for the time being we will transliterate
Ugunu/UxKASKAL ("10 bur") with "bur'u" in avoidance of either buru
(assigned to BUR by the sign lists) or burux (requiring description
in parentheses that would unnecessarily complicate perl scripting);
in like manner, szar'u for SZAR2xU, although this sign is listed
with the value szaru by Borger.</p>
