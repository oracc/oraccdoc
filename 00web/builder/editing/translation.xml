<esp:title>Translations</esp:title>
<html><head/><body>

<p class="firstpara">Translations may be input as interlinear, within the ATF files,
  or extralinear either within ATF files or separately. The Oracc translation format and the special
  facilities it provides are described
  here.</p>




<esp:h>Location</esp:h>

<p>Translations are a special part of an ATF text; they may be given
within an ATF text which contains a transliteration or they may be in
their own ATF text.  If they are in their own ATF text they require
their own <code>&amp;</code>-line which must be identical to the
<code>&amp;</code>-line used in the corresponding transliteration (see
<esp:link page="atftut" bookmark="andlines">the ATF tutorial</esp:link> for
further details on <code>&amp;</code>-lines).</p>

<p>Because the ATF processor requires access to both the
transliteration and the translation of a text it is easiest practice
to give translations along with the transliteration.  While this is
not a requirement, because the ATF processor can read multiple files
on a single run and process them all simultaneously, the multi-file
facility is not presently available in the webservice.</p>



<esp:h>Types</esp:h>

<p>All translation types except interlinear are introduced by a
<code>@translation</code> command followed by the translation type, a
language code, and the word <code>project</code>. The keyword
<code>project</code> indicates that this is the default translation of
a text within a project, in order to facilitate cross-project sharing
of texts.</p>

<esp:sh>Interlinear</esp:sh>

<p>Interlinear translations are given using the ATF protocol <code class="example">#tr.&lt;LANG&gt;:</code>; the translation follows.  A
language code may be given after a period: these language codes must
follow the Oracc rules for language codes as given in the <esp:link page="gdltut" bookmark="sh_languages">GDL tutorial</esp:link>.  For an English
translation the protocol would then be <span class="cookbook">#tr.en:</span>.</p>

<p>If no language code is given the default is <code>en</code>.</p>

<esp:sh>Parallel</esp:sh>

<p>Parallel translations start with the command:</p>

<pre class="cookbook">
@translation parallel en project
</pre>

<p>(Here and in the following examples <code>en</code> may be any
standard language code.)</p>

<p>The remainder of the translation must use exactly the same
structural labeling as the transliteration; the ATF processor will
automatically align the transliteration and translation using their
common structure.</p>

<esp:sh>Labeled</esp:sh>

<p>Labeled translations start with the command:</p>

<pre class="cookbook">
@translation labeled en project
</pre>

<p>Subsequent blocks of translation are introduced by
<code>@label</code>  or <code>@( )</code> commands where the remainder of the line, or the contents of the parentheses, gives the
label.  The label must be either a single label which matches a line
label in the translated source, or a range, i.e., a pair of labels
giving the start and end lines.</p>

<p>The following are all examples of valid translation labels:</p>

<pre class="example">
@label o 17</pre>

<p>This labels the translation of a single line of transliteration, from obverse line 17. It can also be written as <code>@(o 17)</code>.</p>
<pre class="example">
@label r ii 3' - r ii 4'</pre>
<p>This label, which can also be written as <code>@(r ii 3' - r ii 4')</code>, marks a block of translation that runs from reverse column 2, line 3' to line 4'. Even though they are adjacent lines on the same column, the start line and end line must both be given explicitly. A label <code>@label r ii 3' - 4'</code> is an error.</p>
<pre class="example">
@label l.e. 1 - t.e. 2
</pre>
<p>Labels can describe blocks of translation that cross surfaces and columns. This example, which can also be written <code class="example">@(l.e. 1 - t.e. 2)</code>, runs from the first line of the left edge to the second line of the top edge.</p>

<p>If you want to have two lines labelled exactly the same way, use <code>+</code> after the <code>@label</code>. For instance:</p>

<pre class="example">
@label r 6
Witnesses: Anu-belšunu, son of Nidinti-Anu, descendant of Sin-leqe-unninni;

@label+ r 6
Anu-ab-uter, son of Anu-belšunu, descendant of Sin-leqe-unninni;
</pre>

<p>It is not necessary to use the <code>+</code> if your second label is, say, <code>@label r 6 - r 7</code>.</p> 

<p><strong>N.B.:</strong> Labeling in translations must always be
done at the line level; a label such as <code>r</code> (reverse) is an
error.</p>

<p>For further explanation of how labels work, and a complete list of label abbreviations,
see the <esp:link page="labels">labels</esp:link> documentation.</p>



<esp:sh>Unitary</esp:sh>

<p>Unitary translations—those whose translation blocks correspond to
the annotated units (usually sentences) of a transliteration—start
with the command.</p>

<pre class="cookbook">
@translation unitary en project
</pre>

<p>Subsequent blocks of translation are introduced by
<code>@unit</code> commands where the remainder of the line gives a
unit number; these can be found in the unit-view of the source
texts—typically unit 1 is the first sentence, unit 2 is the second
sentence, and so on.</p>

<p>Unitary translations may also follow <code>@unit</code> with a
<code>@span</code> command which follows the same rules as a
<code>@label</code> line. </p>

<esp:h>Conventions</esp:h>

<esp:sh>Block</esp:sh>

<p>A small set of essential block-level commands is available in
labeled and unitary translation styles; if you want to use these block
commands with interlinear or parallel styles, you can't.  You must
first convert your translation to use labeled or unitary style.</p>

<esp:sh>Paragraphs</esp:sh>

<p>For labeled and unitary translation types the content of a
translation unit is a single paragraph.  A blank line is
<strong>required</strong> to close the paragraph.</p>

<p>For parallel and interlinear translation types the content of a
translation unit is the rest of the line following the label or
<code>#tr:</code>, as well as any following lines which start with at
least one space and which do not consist only of spaces:</p>

<pre class="cookbook">
#tr: this is a long interlinear translation which is more comfortably
     handled if split over more than one line.</pre>

<esp:sh>Headings</esp:sh>

<p>In labeled and unitary translation types headings may be used
before the <code>@label</code>s.  A heading consists of a paragraph
beginning with one of the commands: <code>@h1</code>,
<code>@h2</code>, <code>@h3</code> specifying first, second and third
level headings respectively.</p>

<p>The content of a heading may use the same inline conventions as
translation content.</p>

<pre class="cookbook">
@h1 Inana steals the @me

@label o 1 - o 10
...</pre>

<esp:sh>Dollar Lines</esp:sh>

<p>Translations may contain dollar-lines, in which case they must
ordinarily correspond on a 1:1 basis with the $-lines in the
transliteration.  <esp:link bookmark="h_alignment">See below</esp:link> for a discussion of
how to handle situations which do not conform to this constraint.</p>

<esp:sh>Notes</esp:sh>

<p>In labeled and unitary translation types notes may be given
immediately after either headings or translation paragraphs.  These
notes may begin with a note marker corresponding to a note marker in
the preceding heading or translation content (see Inline Conventions
below):</p>

<pre class="cookbook">
@label 1

The girl^1^ stood on the burning deck.

@note ^1^ Three manuscripts read instead: boy.

@label 2
...</pre>

<p>If no note marker is given the note is automatically linked to the
entire preceding heading or translation unit.</p>

<p>A note may contain one or more paragraphs; paragraphs are separated
by blank lines (the processor understands that a line containing only
spaces is a "blank line").  A blank line is <strong>required</strong>
to close the final paragraph of the note.</p>

<esp:sh>Inline</esp:sh>

<esp:sh>Characters</esp:sh>

<p>The character set used must be Unicode—no ATF translation of sz (for š)
and similar conventions is done.</p>

<esp:sh>Supplied</esp:sh>

<p>Text supplied for the sense is given in parentheses, e.g., <code class="example">He (Gudea) brought (stone) down from (the
mountain).</code></p>

<esp:sh>Literal</esp:sh>

<p>Where the literal rendering is known but inadequate for the
context, a word or words may be bracketed by matched pairs of <code class="cookbook">@"..."@</code> commands, e.g., <code class="example">...ignore the @"striking"@ among...</code>.</p>

<esp:sh>Foreign</esp:sh>

<p>Foreign words are indicated by placing an '@'-sign before the word,
e.g., <code class="example">Inana took the @me</code>.</p>

<esp:sh>Uncertain</esp:sh>

<p>Uncertain translations are bracketed by matched pairs of
<code class="cookbook">@?...?@</code> commands (note that the close-uncertain form is
query then at-sign), e.g., <code class="example">@?he built the temple?@</code>.</p>

<esp:sh>Untranslateable</esp:sh>

<p>Untranslateable passages should be indicated by an ellipsis
(<code class="cookbook">...</code>).  At the end of a sentence, a four-dot ellipsis
should be used (<code class="cookbook">....</code>). Every sequences of one or more x's in the transliteration should be represented by a (<code class="cookbook">...</code>) in the transliteration.</p>

<esp:sh>Broken</esp:sh>
<p>For every <code class="cookbook">[...]</code> or sequence of x's in square brackets in the transliteration there should be a matching <code class="cookbook">[...]</code> in the translation.</p>
<p>Words that are entirely restored in the transliteration should be in square brackets <code class="cookbook">[ ]</code> in the translation, but partially restored ones should not. Do not put square brackets in the middle of words but use <code class="cookbook">@? ?@</code> to mark uncertainty if appropriate.</p>

<esp:sh>Note markers</esp:sh>

<p>Note markers may be given by placing numbers between matched pairs
of caret (<code>^</code>) characters: <code class="example">this is
noted.^1^</code>.  Multiple notes may be referenced in a single marker
by separating them with commas.</p>

<esp:h>Projects</esp:h>

<p>Certain aspects of translation are project-specific and should be
defined in a project style-manual.  These include, among others,
practices for normalizing proper names and whether or not to indicate
breakage on the original object in the translation.</p>

<esp:h>Alignment</esp:h>

<p>For most situations the default handling of alignment of
transliteration and translation is adequate.  In the normal case, each
labeled translation block must have a corresponding label in the
translation, and each translation dollar-line must have a matching
dollar-line in the transliteration.</p>

<p>For special purposes—including migrating legacy data—several
non-standard combinations of alignment are supported in ATF,
however.</p>

<esp:sh>Out of sequence translations</esp:sh>

<p>Sometimes you want to translate a block, say lines 3 to 8, 
but with the last line first.  It would be tempting to say 
<code>@label 8 - 7</code> but this doesn't work because of the
way the ATF processor uses the labels to do alignment of
translation and transliteration.</p>

<p>Instead, you can use the label-as construction, in which the
alignment label is given first as usual, then the displayed label
is given afterwards.  If you are using this method of alignment you
should not use ranges in labels—just let the ATF processor determine
the end of the block for you.</p>

<p>The label-as construction consists of a label, an equals sign surrounded
by spaces, and a second label:</p>

<pre class="cookbook">@label 3 = 8</pre>

<p>Means: align on line 3, but display as line 8.</p>

<esp:sh>Labeling lines within a paragraph</esp:sh>

<p>Some people like to label the lines of a translation within the block.  Do
this using the <code>@lab{...}</code> tag—this is set up to use the same 
display conventions as regular labels.</p>

<pre class="cookbook">@label 1 - 4

This is some @lab{3}text with @lab{4}an unusual translation 
@lab{2}sequence.
</pre>

<esp:sh>@-heading only in translation</esp:sh>

<p>This does not require any special action as the formatter
automatically handles it; it is important to know, though, that the
opposite case is not automatically handled: see the next
paragraph.</p>

<esp:sh>@-heading only in transliteration</esp:sh>

<p>In this case, it is necessary to give empty headings in the
translation to align the transliteration/translation correctly.</p>

<pre class="cookbook">
@h1 Inscription 1
@m=locator Inscription_1

1. %arc mnn 15 b zy ʾrqʾ

@h1 Inscription 2
@m=locator Inscription_2

1. %arc ḥmšt ʿšr mnyn [zy] mlk

@translation labeled en project

@h1

@(Inscription_1 1) Fifteen @i{mina}s (by the standard) of the land.

@h1

@(Inscription_2 1) Fifteen @i{mina}s [of] the king.
</pre>

<esp:sh>$-line only in transliteration</esp:sh>

<p>This does not necessarily require any special action; the
translation automatically aligns on labels.  An empty $-line may
be used in the translation, however, the difference between no dollar line
and and an empty dollar line being that in the former case the
block-alignment of a labeled translation will extend to include the
transliteration's $-line; in the latter case, the two $-lines will
align, so the translation block will stop at the line before the
transliteration's $-line.</p>

<esp:sh>$-line only in translation</esp:sh>

<p>To create this effect an empty $-line must be entered in the
transliteration.</p>

<esp:sh>$-line in transliteration aligns with translation block</esp:sh>

<p>To do this, the transliteration $-line must first be given a label
using the syntax <code class="example">$@(LABEL)</code>, where
<code>LABEL</code> is any unique label within the text.  To achieve
the alignment, the translation must then use the same label; this
label is purely a convenience and is never rendered.</p>

<esp:sh>$-line in translation aligns with text line in
transliteration</esp:sh>

<p>Again, the $-line must be labeled in order to achieve this
effect—in this case, the label of the transliteration line must be
given as in, e.g., <code class="cookbook">$@(r 1)</code>.</p>

<p>Note that this idiom can also be used to align a translation $-line
with a surface or column @-command in the transliteration.  To align
with <code>@reverse</code> you simply write, say, <code class="cookbook">$@(r) Rev</code>.</p>

<esp:sh>Transliteration line is untranslated</esp:sh>

<p>If the transliteration should have space facing it, or some kind of
comment, simply use an empty $-line with a label, as in the previous
example.</p>

<esp:sh>Translation has no corresponding transliteration</esp:sh>

<p>This effect can be obtained by creating a dummy transliteration
line, which must have a unique label and contain only the inline
comment <code>(#DUMMY#)</code>.  The translation must use the dummy
line's label; the dummy line creates no output other than blank
space.</p>

<esp:sh>A single transliteration line has two or more translation blocks</esp:sh>

<p>By default, the processor complains about this situation with a
<code class="example">translation alignment out of order</code>
warning.  To instruct the processor that this situation is in fact
correct, follow the label with a <code>+</code> sign:</p>

<pre class="example">
...
9. IGI {m}bar-ruq ITI ZIZ₂
...
@(9) Witness Barruq.

@(9)+ Month Shebat.
