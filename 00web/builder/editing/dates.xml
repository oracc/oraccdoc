<esp:name>Dates</esp:name>
<esp:title>Date Specifications for CDLI/Oracc</esp:title>

<html><head/><body>

<p class="firstpara">This document describes the conventions used for
  specifying dates in the CDLI catalogs and gives a list of kings and
  dynasties.  This list is a work-in-progress; e-mail corrections to
  Steve Tinney at <esp:email address="stinney@upenn.edu"/>.</p>



<esp:h>Scheme</esp:h>

<p>The general scheme of dates is a sequence of up to five members
giving the following data:</p>

<pre class="example">
[DYNASTY/ERA] . [RULER] . [YEAR] . [MONTH] . [DAY]</pre>

<p>The actual syntax of a single date specification gives an instance
of each of these members with the members separated by periods:</p>

<pre class="cookbook">
Ur III.Shulgi.23.04.5</pre>

<p>The form of each member is described in the following below.</p>

<esp:sh>Dynasties</esp:sh>

<p>A dynasty is specified using the basic combination:</p>

<pre class="example">
[CITY] [NUMBER]</pre>

<p>This specification is deliberately open-ended since new finds will
inevitably require additional dynasty designations. Actual examples
include:</p>

<pre class="cookbook">
Lagash I
Agade
Lagash II
Ur III
Isin I
Larsa
Babylon I
Mari</pre>

<p>In transcriptions of city and ruler names /sh/ is used for /shin/.</p>

<esp:sh>Eras</esp:sh>

<p>The Seleucid Era is indicated by the prefix <code>SE</code>. [more
needed here]</p>

<esp:sh>Rulers</esp:sh>

<p>Rulers are specified by giving the normal form of their name in
transcription rather than transliteration and are normalized following
Brinkman's list in <i>Ancient Mesopotamia</i>, if they occur in that
list.  Rulers must be unique within their dynasty, appending the
conventional 'I', 'II' etc., as required.  A provisional list of
dynasties and rulers follows.</p>

<esp:sh>Years</esp:sh>

<p>Years are given using the lettering or numbering system appropriate
to the dynasty/ruler in question.  For years which correspond to
year-names the canonical equivalency of year-name to year-number is
given below.</p>

<p>Where years are named by symbols other than year-names, such as
limmu-officials, the year may be given as the number in the
reign of the ruler, the symbol, or both.  The syntax of this is:</p>

<pre class="example">
[YEAR]? =? [SYMBOL]?
</pre>

<p>Where either part is optional and the equals-sign may be omitted if
both parts are not given.  If <code>[SYMBOL]</code> could be confused
with a year letter or number, the equals-sign must be given.</p>

<p>In the following examples, (1) shows how to indicate a date
according to a year named after a limmu at Tuttul where the year of
the ruler's reign which corresponds to the limmu is unknown.  Example
(2) shows how to do the same when the year of the ruler is known:</p>

<pre class="cookbook">
(1)  Tuttul.Yasmah-Addu.3=Ibni-Adad.06.09
(2)  Tuttul.Yasmah-Addu.Ibni-Adad.06.09
</pre>

<esp:sh>Months</esp:sh>

<p>Months consist of one or two parts:</p>

<pre class="example">
[CALENDAR] [NUMBER|NAME]

or

[NUMBER|NAME]</pre>

<p>The optional <code class="example">CALENDAR</code> portion consists
of a city name or other code which identifies the date's calendar if
that calendar is not the standard Mesopotamian calendar.</p>

<p>The <code>NUMBER|NAME</code> portion consists of either a month
number given as a pair of arabic numerals or the transcription of a
month name; the latter convention should only be used for months whose
position in a given calendar is uncertain.</p>

<esp:sh>Days</esp:sh>

<p>Days are given as a pair of arabic numerals.</p>

<esp:sh>Hyphen</esp:sh>

<p>Unspecified components of the date are given with double zero ('00'); 
components which are broken are given with double hyphen ('--'):</p>

<pre class="cookbook">
Ur III.00.00.4.25 <span class="comment">(no year name given)</span>

Ur III.--.--.4.25 (year name broken)</pre>
