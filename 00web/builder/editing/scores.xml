<html><head/><body>
<p class="firstpara">This document describes how to create scores using Oracc.</p>



<esp:h>Overview</esp:h>

<p>Oracc divides scores into two types and two modes.  The two types
are the matrix and the synopsis; the two modes are parsed and
unparsed.  To specify that an ATF transliteration is some kind of
score, you give one of the following @-protocols immediately after the
&amp;-line:</p>

<pre class="cookbook">
@score matrix parsed
@score matrix unparsed
@score synopsis parsed
@score synopsis unparsed
</pre>

<p>Both types of scores use a composite line--the reconstructed line
which does not belong to a physical source--and exemplar lines, which
are the individual manuscript witnesses.  In a synopsis, the composite
line may be empty; in either type the exemplars may be empty.</p>

<esp:sh>Matrix</esp:sh>

<p>In a matrix, the composite line is used to establish a set of
columns; the exemplar lines are given in schematic form, with each
column of the composite having a corresponding entry in the exemplars'
columns.  Matrices may be specified at the grapheme or word level: in
Sumerian, they are typically specified at the grapheme level.  The
actual rules for matrices are given later in this page, but an example
will give the general idea:</p>

<pre class="cookbook">
1.     	   šag4-ga-ne2 er2 im-si  edin-še3  ba-ra-e3

N1,i_1:    .    .  ,   +   +  +   +    ,    +  +  +
N2,1:	   +	+  +   .   .  .   .    .    .  .  .
N3,1:	   +    .  .   .   .  .   .    .    .  .  .
Ki4,1:	   .	.  .   .   .  .   ,    +    +  +  +
Šad1,1:	   .	+  +   +   +  +   +    +    ,  .  .
Su1,2':	   .	.  .   .   .  ši  +    .    .  .  .
X5,i_1:	   .	.  .   .   .  .   .    .    .  .  .
</pre>

<p>The default matrix-level is graphemic.  To specify that your matrix
is word-level in a parsed score, add the token <code>word</code> at
the end of the <code>@score</code> line (note that you don't need to
do this with an unparsed matrix):</p>

<pre class="cookbook">
@score matrix parsed word
</pre>

<esp:sh>Synopsis</esp:sh>

<p>In a synopsis, the composite line and exemplar lines are both
written out in full.  The composite line may be empty, but this is not
a recommended practice (it is allowed, as there is so much legacy data
using this approach, but for new data the editor should, whenever
possible, specify the composite text and ensure that it is properly
used as the basis for translation).</p>

<esp:sh>Parsed</esp:sh>

<p>In a parsed score, the composite and exemplar lines are validated
and parsed according to the respective rules of the score types.</p>

<esp:sh>Unparsed</esp:sh>

<p>In an unparsed score, the composite line must be parsable, but the
exemplars are treated as a blob of text which is opaque to Oracc's
parsers.  This is strictly a transitional feature, which allows legacy
data to be presented to users until such time as the necessary changes
can be made to bring the score in line with Oracc parsing
conventions.</p>

<esp:h>Conventions</esp:h>

<esp:sh>Labels</esp:sh>

<p>The composite and exemplar line-labeling conventions are shared by
all types and modes of score.</p>

<esp:sh>Composite</esp:sh>

<p>The composite line label has the same format as any other
transliteration line in ATF: it is a string terminated by a period and
one or more space or tab characters.</p>

<esp:sh>Exemplar</esp:sh>

<p>An exemplar line label is basically string terminated by a colon and one or
more space or tab characters.  This string, however, has its own
internal structure, consisting of a siglum, or code for a witness, and
an optional line label.</p>

<dl>
<dt>Siglum</dt>

<dd>The siglum is typically a letter, often with numeric subscripts.
To assist in alignment, numeric subscripts should be given with ASCII
digits 0..9, which are automatically converted to Unicode subscript
numbers by the processor.</dd>

<dd>In all types and modes of scores, the sigla must be defined in the
ATF source for the score even when they are also defined in an
external catalogue.  This is done using the <code>#link</code>
protocol:</dd>

<dd><pre class="cookbook">
#link: def A = P123456 = N 1
</pre></dd>

<dd>Additional identifiers may be given, but need not be.  If no
P-number has been assigned to the source, an X-number may be used, in
which case additional identifiers such as publication places are
strongly encouraged:</dd>

<dd><pre class="cookbook">
#link: def B = X000001 = N 1 = PBS 1, 29
</pre></dd>

<dt>Siglum Map</dt>

<dd>Siglum maps can be used when the exemplar lines reference a tablet
by fragment rather than the main source.  To use this feature, first
declare the exemplar as above, then define the maps, then use the
fragment reference in the exemplar lines.</dd>

<dd>The template for a map entry is:</dd>
<dd><pre class="example">
#key: siglum-map FROM_SIGLUM=>TO_SIGLUM</pre></dd>

<dd>Putting all of the components together, a full example looks like this:</dd>

<dd><pre class="cookbook">
#link: def A = cmawro:P445799 = KUB 37, 44-49

...

#key: siglum-map A₁=>A
#key: siglum-map A₂=>A
#key: siglum-map A₃=>A

...

A₁,obv_i_1′:	...
</pre></dd>

<dt>Label</dt>

<dd>A line-label may also be given, separated from the siglum by a
comma.  The label should conform to Oracc standards, with spaces
replaced by underscores:</dd>

<dd><pre class="cookbook">
A,i_1: a
</pre></dd>

<dd>A label may reference part of a line by including letter
subscripts separated from the label by a semi-colon:</dd>

<dd><pre class="cookbook">
A,i_1;a: a
</pre></dd>

<dd>A label may reference a range, separating the parts with a hyphen
surrounded by underscores (the Oracc label specification requires
spaces around a range-hyphen as line-numbers themselves may contain
hyphens):</dd>

<dd><pre class="cookbook">
A,i_1_-_i_2b: a
</pre></dd>
</dl>

<esp:sh>Synopses</esp:sh>

<p>Synopsis conventions for parsed line-content are simple: they are
regular ATF.</p>

<esp:sh>Matrices</esp:sh>

<p>Matrices have quite different conventions for composite and
exemplar lines.</p>

<esp:sh>Composite </esp:sh>

<p>Composite lines in matrices are basically in ATF, with these
additions:</p>

<dl>
<dt>#</dt>
<dd>A hash-sign can be used to create an empty column in the
composite; this is used when an exemplar has additional material which
is not included in the composite.</dd>

<dt>0</dt>
<dd>A number-zero can be used as a grapheme to create an additional
column within a word.  This is useful when, for example, an exemplar
has an  additional component in a Sumerian verbal prefix chain.</dd>
</dl>

<esp:sh>Exemplar Grapheme Codes </esp:sh>

<dl>
<dt>+ (plus sign)</dt>
<dd>grapheme positively preserved</dd>
<dt>- (minus sign)</dt>
<dd>grapheme positively omitted</dd>
<dt><code>.</code> (period)</dt>
<dd>grapheme broken</dd>
<dt><code>,</code> (comma)</dt>
<dd>grapheme traces fit composite</dd>
<dt><code>x</code> (lowercase letter ex)</dt>
<dd>grapheme traces do not fit composite</dd>
<dt><code>^</code> (caret)</dt>
<dd>exemplar adds following sign relative to composite</dd>
<dt><code>#</code> (hash)</dt>
<dd>creates empty cell as in composite; if text is broken, use
<code>#</code> or <code>.</code> depending on whether it is likely
that the exemplar originally may have had a corresponding sign</dd>
</dl>

<esp:sh>Exemplar Code Flags</esp:sh>

<p>These are a subset of the standard ATF flags (<code>#</code> is not
used as a flag in matrices):</p>

<dl>
<dt>!</dt>
<dd>corrected reading</dd>
<dt>?</dt>
<dd>uncertain reading</dd>
<dt>*</dt>
<dd>collated</dd>
</dl>

<esp:sh>Exemplar Line Divisions</esp:sh>

<dl>
<dt><code>;</code> (semi-colon)</dt>
<dd>indented line split point</dd>
<dt><code>/</code> (forward slash)</dt>
<dd>line break (often with ruling; used with ranges)</dd>
</dl>

<esp:sh>Replacements</esp:sh>

<dl>
<dt><code>&amp; (ampersand)</code></dt>
<dd>at start of alignment column means text replaces how
ever many columns the corresponding word occupies in the
main text; must come at the start of a word.</dd>

<dt>&amp;[0-9] (ampersand followed by digits)</dt>
<dd>at start of alignment column means text replaces how 
ever many columns the corresponding number of words occupy 
in the main text; must come at the start of a word.</dd>

<dt>&amp;&amp; (double ampersand)</dt>
<dd>at start of alignment column means following text replaces
rest of line; no word alignment is done in this case.</dd>
</dl>

<esp:sh>Dollar-lines</esp:sh>

<p>Lines beginning with a <code>$</code> are ATF $-line.  If the
$-line comes immediately after the composite, it is included in the
composite.  If the $-line contains an exemplar label, it pertains to
that witness:</p>

<pre class="cookbook">
Ki1: $ Omits.
</pre>

<esp:h>Computing Witness Transliterations</esp:h>

<p>Oracc can compute transliterations from scores of both kinds by
sorting on the labels, splitting and reassembling portions of lines as
necessary.  For parsed synopses this procedure is relatively
straightforward as the transliterations are already ATF.  For unparsed
synopses the witness transliteration is assumed invalid by the Oracc
processor and is presented as-is.</p>

<p>For matrices, only the parsed form can be turned into witness
transliterations: unparsed matrices cannot be meaningfully handled by
the processor.</p>

<esp:h>Matrix Witnesses</esp:h>

<p>In a matrix, the grapheme codes are simply replaced as appropriate
with graphemes from the composite line.  Where the exemplar contains
transliteration, the texts  replaces the text in the composite line.
This results in a number of preferred-practice recommendations to
ensure that the witness generation is as accurate as possible:</p>

<ul>
<li>If the text involves different hyphenation the word or words
should be given in their entirety, with the relevant &amp;-span
notation (to enable correct derivation of exemplar transliterations
from the matrix).  See DD 25 where both of the words must vary from
the composite and so it might be tempting to use rest-of-line
transliteration.  Instead, we do word alignment for each word so that
variant searching can work</li>

<li>Where reasonable, word alignment should be maintained, but where
texts diverge extensively there may be no alternative to
transliterating the exemplar in full (see DD line 13, exemplar Ki₁ for
examples of both word alignment and rest-of-line
transliteration).</li>

<li><p>The note marker ^[DIGITS]^ should be used in the matrix to handle
insertions that belong in the witness transliteration but which
overload the matrix structure.  If the text immediately following the
corresponding note label begins with a +, it is included with the
matrix line's text when the source is rendered as a witness
transliteration; this text must be terminated by a period followed by
a space.</p>

<pre class="cookbook">
55: ... szu-na ba-...  

N₂₁_r_5': + +^1^ 

#note: +{{NI?}} . Any note begins here ...  
</pre>
 
<p>Is rendered as:</p>

<pre class="cookbook"> 
5. ... szu-na{{NI?}} ba-... 
</pre>
 
<p>After the initial +, text is inserted literally--to get a space or
hyphen before the text it must be given after the +.  The same rules
apply at the end of the inserted text, hence the space before the
closing period in the example above.</p>
</li>
</ul>
