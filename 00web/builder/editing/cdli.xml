the CDLI repository you should read this document first.</p>



<esp:h>ATF in CDLI and Oracc</esp:h>

<p>Before learning any ATF it is useful to know a little about the
history and current state of ATF.  ATF was developed for use in CDLI,
and was first defined as a relatively small specification which used
only ASCII characters.  Over time, two things have happened.
Firstly, the range of texts encoded in ATF has grown, and ATF has
grown with it.  Secondly, ATF has been extended to allow
Assyriologists to process legacy data more quickly and to type new
texts in a format that is very close to the way things look on
screen.</p>

<p>Because of the archival nature of the CDLI repository, we do not
allow extended ATF to be used in the repository itself.  Texts in
Oracc's extended ATF will be converted to the archival core ATF format
that we call Canonical ATF (C-ATF).  <strong>Although C-ATF does not
imitate the print versions of texts, C-ATF can be converted to a
pretty-printed version using <esp:link url="http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/doc/wwwhome/util/atfproc.html">this
webservice</esp:link>.</strong></p>

<p><strong>If you are typing texts to go directly into the CDLI
repository you must follow the instructions in this document so that
you create Canonical ATF (C-ATF) directly.</strong></p>

<esp:h>Oracc Documentation</esp:h>

<p>Oracc documentation is generally written using extended ATF; when
you are writing C-ATF you need to be careful to adjust the examples
appropriately.</p>

<esp:h>C-ATF Main Points</esp:h>

<ul>
<li>ASCII Characters only</li>
<li>Sign values in Sumerian must conform to the set of CDLI values;
See <esp:link url="http://cdli.ucla.edu/downloads.html">http://cdli.ucla.edu/downloads.html</esp:link> and contact
<code>cdli@cdli.ucla.edu</code> if you wish to recommend values which
are not listed there.</li>
<li>readings not assigned indices by Borger, MZL, must be followed by
'x' (the letter lowercase ex) and a description of the sign using sign
names in upper case, for instance <code>sudx(|SU.KUR|)</code>.</li>
<li>Never put brackets inside graphemes: write <code>ab#</code> not
<code>[a]b</code>.</li>
<li>For purposes of qualifying state of preservation, both simple and
complex signs are considered atoms; thus, a component of a complex sign 
such as <code>|UR2x(A.HA)|</code> is never qualified as damaged or
broken, only the whole sign.  Similarly, a damaged number notation,
for instance <code>[5(disz)]+4(disz)</code> must be coded as
<code>9(disz)#</code>.</li>
<li>Never put logograms in capitals: only uninterpreted sign names,
and complex signs are in upper case in C-ATF</li>
<li>For logograms in non-Sumerian texts use underscores
and lower case, i.e., write <code>%a
_lugal_</code>, not <code>%a LUGAL</code>.</li>
<li>For logograms where the logogram language is not Sumerian, use a
language switch after the underscore: <code>(%hit ...) _%a mu-u2_</code></li>
<li>All numbers must be qualified (<code>3(disz)</code>,
<code>4(u)</code> etc.) <strong>except</strong> sexagesimal
numbers in Place Value notation (PVN).</li>
<li>The only ATF protocols that are allowed in C-ATF are:
<ul>
  <li><code>#atf: lang XXX</code>, where XXX is a language code</li>
  <li><code>#atf: use math</code>, where PVN is to be used</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The <code>#</code>-sign ("hash"-sign) introduces comments about
individual line content and always follows the commented line</li>
<li>The <code>$</code>-sign introduces comment of text structure,
never of line content</li>
<li><code>$</code>-lines for breakage of uncertain length must conform 
to the following patterns:<ul>
<li><code>$ broken</code> (for instances of loss of full surface or column)</li>
<li><code>$ beginning broken</code> (after this, use primes on
subsequent line numbers but where the length of the break is known,
instead enter all line numbers and use <code>[...]</code> for the line
content; <code>beginning broken</code> may also refer to some unknown
number of columns missing, after which the first preserved column is
to be qualified <code>@column 1'</code> and so on)</li>
<li><code>$ rest broken</code> (see above for both missing lines and columns)</li>
<li><code>$ n lines broken</code> (within column and surface; line
numbering after resumption of preserved text is in sequence with the
number preceding the break with, for example, <code>5'.</code>
following either <code>4.</code> or <code>4'.</code>.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<esp:h>Examples in C-ATF</esp:h>


<esp:sh>Example 1</esp:sh>
<pre class="cookbook">
&amp;P100003 = AAS 015
#atf: lang sux
@tablet
@obverse
1. 1(disz) geme2 u4 1(disz)-sze3
2. ki dingir-ra-ta
3. da-da-ga
4. szu ba-ti
@reverse
1. mu ki-masz{ki} ba-hul</pre> 

<p>The various ATF features illustrated here are:</p>
<dl>
<dt>The <code>&amp;-line</code></dt>
<dd>Every text begins with an <code>&amp;-line</code> giving the ID
and the text's designation according to the CDLI catalog; if your text
is not yet in the catalog, e-mail cdli@cdli.ucla.edu to get the ID and
designation.</dd>
<dt><code>#atf: lang sux</code></dt>
<dd>You can specify the main language for the text; for Akkadian just
write <code class="cookbook">#atf: lang akk</code>.</dd>
<dt><code>@tablet</code></dt>
<dd>You can specify an object type; this is normally @tablet, but
others include @bulla and @envelope.  If an object type which is used
in the CDLI catalog is not understood by the ATF processor, you can
use the exactly equivalent form <code>@object OBJECT_TYPE</code>,
e.g., <code>@object head</code>.</dd>
<dt><code>@obverse, @reverse</code></dt>
<dd>You can specify the part of the object you are transliterating;
the edges are given using: <code class="cookbook">@left @right @top
@bottom</code> (but note that no physical surface of a tablet is to be
included in C-ATF unless it, such as <code>@left</code> or in the case
of occasional partial sums at the bottom of colums in Ur III
administrative texts, assumes an explicit function in text
format)</dd>
<dt>Lines of text</dt>
<dd>Lines of text are for the most part just like regular
Assyriological practice.  See <esp:link bookmark="sh_example2">Example 2</esp:link> for how to do breakage.</dd>
<dt>Determinatives, phonetic complements and glosses</dt>
<dd><p>Determinatives are given in curly brackets.</p> 
<p>Phonetic complements and glosses are marked with a <code>+</code> immediately after the first curly bracket; they are assumed to be in the same language as the rest of the word.</p> </dd>
<dt>Rulings and Blank Spaces</dt>
<dd>Lines ruled on the tablet as paragraph separators, as well as
empty space or space used for seal impressions, can be marked with
$-lines ("dollar-lines").</dd>
<dt>Numbers</dt>
<dd>All numbers are qualified.</dd>
</dl>

<esp:sh>Example 2</esp:sh>

<pre class="cookbook">
&amp;P348658 = SpTU 2, 055
#atf: lang akk
@tablet

@obverse
1.	t,up-pi _a-sza3_ ki-szub-ba#-[a ...]
2.	{i7}har-ri sza2 {d}muati? x [...]
3.	Å¡a2 qe2-reb unu#[{ki}]
</pre>

<dl>
<dt>Damage and breakage</dt>
<dd><p>There are no half-brackets in ATF: signs which are damaged are
flagged with the hash-sign (<code>#</code>) after the grapheme.</p>
<p>Signs which are completely broken away are placed in square
brackets; square brackets may not occur inside a grapheme, only before
or after it.  The ellipsis (<code>...</code>) may be used to indicate that an
undeterminable number of signs is missing.</p>
<p>Signs which cannot be identified are transliterated as
<code>x</code>; when a number is missing the convention is to use
<code>n</code> as in <code class="cookbook">n(disz)</code>.  Both
within or after the parentheses further qualification of
<code>n</code> as <code>n(disz)</code> is allowed.</p></dd>
<dt>Querying, Correction and Collation</dt>
<dd>The other flags are the query (<code>?</code>) which can be placed
after a grapheme to indicate uncertainty of reading; the asterisk
(<code>*</code>) which indicates a collated reading; and the
exclamation mark which indicates correction.  After a corrected sign,
the actual sign on the tablet may optionally be given, using sign
names in upper case: <code class="cookbook">a!</code> or <code class="cookbook">ki!(DI)</code>.</dd>
