<esp:title>SUX: Oracc Linguistic Annotation for Sumerian</esp:title>
<html><head/><body>

<p class="firstpara">This document provides an overview of
  language-specific annotation conventions for Sumerian used in Oracc.  
  We focus here on the data-entry view of
  linguistic annotation giving only enough additional technical
  background to ensure that correct annotation of ATF files can be
  carried out.
</p>



<esp:h>Overview</esp:h>

<p>Sumerian lemmatization works by drawing information from four
places (unless a project has been configured in a non-standard
manner):</p>

<ul>
<li>New entries in the interlinear lemmatization in the file</li>
<li>The project glossary, <code>00lib/sux.glo</code></li>
<li>ePSD, from the development version which is searchable <esp:link url="http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/epsd/cbd/sux">on oracc</esp:link></li>
<li>The morphological analyzer</li>
</ul>

<p>This structure results in the phenomemon of clean files producing
the occasional harvestable item.  What is happening is that the
lemmatizer finds a match in ePSD, and that satisfies it.  But
harvesting is done by reference only to the project glossary, so the
harvester finds something new to give notice about.</p>


<esp:h>Fields</esp:h>

<p>Sumerian uses the same basic parts of speech as Akkadian, but with
the addition of three important ones:</p>

<ul>
<li>MORPH: the morphological analysis</li>
<li>BASE: the base form of the dictionary word as it occurs in the
writing</li>
<li>CONT: a continuation grapheme, i.e., normally a sign whose
consonant is the same as the end of the citation form of the word, and
whose vowel is either non-functional or contributes to the post-verbal
morphology.</li>
</ul>


<esp:h>Principles</esp:h>

<p>As a matter of principle, it is best to do as little as possible
when lemmatizing Sumerian--let the machine do the work wherever
possible.  In the normal case, it is enough to lemmatize with a
citation form and a sense--all of the other components will get filled
in for you by either ePSD or the morphological analyzer.</p>

<p>In particular, ePSD's approach to adjectives in Sumerian is that
almost all of them are simply verbs, whose nonfinite forms can be used
in a variety of ways including modifiers and participles.  We
generally do not tag these using the Extended POS (EPOS), even where a
word has more than one listed POS in ePSD.  For example, you can
lemmatize <code>nir</code> as <code>nir[lordly]</code> or
<code>nir[lord]</code> and the lemmatizer will find the right POS/EPOS
combination for you.</p>

<p>In the absence of proper documentation on how to do ePSD-style
morphology, it is best simply to leave <code>X</code> for the
morphology field for now.</p>

<esp:h>Additional Fields</esp:h>

<p>For Sumerian two non-standard fields are used: the BASE and the
CONT (continuation).  Additionally, morphological analysis is
implemented for Sumerian, and the lemmatizer automatically calls the
morphological analyzer (SMA, Sumerian Morphological Analyzer) to
fill in the BASE, CONT and MORPH fields if possible.  This means
that most Sumerian lemmatization is the same as any other language.</p>

<esp:sh>BASE</esp:sh>

<p>For some languages part of the written instance gives a particular
base form of the word, for example in Sumerian <code>mu-un-du3</code>
the base is <code>du3</code>.  It is normally unnecessary to specify
this unless the form being lemmatized uses a base which is new.  When
given as part of the lemmatization this must come after the closing
square bracket and is introduced by a forward slash (<code>/</code>)
character:</p>

<pre class="example">
1.     mu-un-du6
#lem:  +du[build]/du6
</pre>

<p>Two special conventions are implemented for bases which combine the
writing of a non-base component with a base component, like the use
of <code>be2</code> for the preverbal <code>b</code> and the
base <code>e</code>.</p>

<ul>
<li>The centered dot, ·, means that a base component is followed by a
non-base component, e.g., ar[praise], has a base
<code>a-r·e</code></li>
<li>The degree symbol, °, means that a non-base component is followed by a base
  component, e.g., e[speak] has base writings
  like <code>m°e</code>.</li>
</ul>

<esp:sh>CONT</esp:sh>

<p>For Sumerian the continuation is the grapheme which encodes the
final consonant of the base as its initial consonant.  It is normally
unnecessary to specify this unless the form being lemmatized is new.
When specified, it must come immediately after the base, separated
from it by a plus sign and then a hyphen (<code>+-</code>):</p>

<pre class="example">
1.     du-ga
#lem:  dug[speak]/du+-ga=g+a
</pre>

<esp:h>Morphology</esp:h>

<p>In Sumerian data-input notation, verbal prefixes are separated from
the base by a colon (<code>:</code>).  Sumerian morphology conventions
are further described [REF]here[REF].  A simple Sumerian example looks
like this: <span class="cookbook">mu.na.ni:~</span>.  A noun with
terminative case-marker looks like this: <span class="cookbook">~,esze</span> (the character which introduces noun
morphemes is the comma (,); subsequent noun-morphemes are separated by
periods.</p>

<p>Morphology may be included directly on the lemmatization, following
any POS.  In such cases, the separator is a hash character
(<code>#</code>) with no surrounding spaces, and the morphology string
following directly afterwards: <span class="cookbook">du[build]V#mu.na.ni:~</span>.  This is mainly needed
for syllabic writings.</p>

<esp:h>Disambiguation</esp:h>

<p>Two common forms of annotation carried out manually are
disambiguation and augmentation; the difference between them is that
disambiguation is necessary when a form give part of a morpheme but
that part could be analyzed more than one way.  The three cases that
are recognized in Sumerian are: Locative-Terminative vs. Ergative when
the form ends in /e/; Locative vs. Genitive when a nominal form ends in /a/;
and Nominalizer vs. Copula when a verbal form ends in /a/.</p>

<p>Augmentation is used when no part of the morpheme is preserved in
the writing of the form; it is an easy way of adding unexpressed
morphemes such as Sumerian /ak/ and other case-markers.  Augmentation
is discussed further below.</p>

<esp:sh>Transitivity</esp:sh>

<p>Disambiguation can be given as part of the sense immediately
before the closing square bracket in a lemmatization string; these
disambiguations refer to choices available in the lexicon.  For
Sumerian a common lexical disambiguation is the choice between
intransitive and transitive in labile verbs or so-called
causatives:</p>

<pre class="example">
\i = select intransitive
\t = select transitive</pre>

<p>We specify the unmarked case to be intransitive so that, e.g.,
<code>gub[stand]</code> needs no further annotation when intransitive;
when transitive it should be annotated as <code>gub[stand\t]</code>.</p>

<p>Further, if distinct words are used in the sense of a verb which
has intransitive and transitive senses it is not necessary to add the
transitivity or the POS.  Thus, <code>dadara[tied]</code> and
<code>dadara[bind]</code> would be taken as intransitive and transitive
respectively without further annotation.</p>

<esp:sh>Morphology</esp:sh>

<p>Ambiguous forms which are susceptible to multiple analyses even
within the same CFGW can be disambiguated using the syntax <code class="example">\&lt;DISAMBIGUATOR&gt;</code>.  The particular
disambiguators are language-specific; examples in Sumerian
include:</p>

<p><strong>Note that this kind of disambiguation only needs to be
carried out when a corpus is destined for syntactic analysis.</strong></p>

<pre class="example">
\a = select locative form
\k = select genitive form

\l = select locative-terminative form (default)
\e = select ergative form

\a = nominalizer
\m = copula (am)
</pre>

<p>For examples see the next version of Gudea 1 below.</p>

<esp:h>Augmentation</esp:h>

<p>Augmentation consists of adding to morphological sequences.
Augmentation is currently primitive and consists exclusively of the
ability to append morphemes at the end of the morphology given in the
forms file.  This is probably only useful for the common case of
adding unexpressed case-markers to Sumerian annotation; for more
complex cases, the entire morphology string must be given inline as
described under 'Inlining' above.</p>

<p>Augmentation is given after POS and the optional disambiguation,
but before any morphology string; it is indicated using the plus sign
(<code>+</code>).</p>

<esp:h>Gudea 1</esp:h>

<p>Given the Disambiguation and Augmentation conventions above, a
sample text can be annotated:</p>

<pre>
&amp;Q000887 = Gudea 1
@composite
1. {d}ba-u2
#lem: DN

2. dumu an-na
#lem: dumu[child]; An[]DN\k

3. nin-a-ni
#lem: nin[lady]+.*ra
