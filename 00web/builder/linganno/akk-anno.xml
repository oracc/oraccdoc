<esp:title>AKK: Oracc Linguistic Annotation for Akkadian</esp:title>

<html><head/><body>

<p class="firstpara">This document provides an overview of
  language-specific annotation conventions for Akkadian used in Oracc.  We focus here on the data-entry view of
  linguistic annotation giving only enough additional technical
  background to ensure that correct annotation of ATF files can be
  carried out.  This document assumes knowledge of the introductory page
  on Oraccc linguistic annotation.</p>



<esp:h>General principles</esp:h>
<p>If you haven't done so already, start by reading some or all of the page on <esp:link page="linganno">Oracc
Linguistic Annotation</esp:link> page.</p>
<p>Lemmatisations take one of two forms:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>short:</strong>
<code>NORM0[SENSE]POS</code> if the lemmatisation is already fully
known by the system (e.g. <code>kalbi[dog]N</code>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<strong>long:</strong>
<code>+CF[GW//SENSE]POS'EPOS$NORM0</code> if the lemmatisation contains any
new information (e.g. <code>+kalbu[dog]N$kalbika</code>).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The main thing to remember is that you are not lemmatising for
other people but for the computer, and that the computer has no
intuition. Inconsistencies produce duplicate entries in the
glossaries, which are fiddly and time-consuming to fix.</p>

<p>After establishing some general principles, we describe in more detail how to manage the different
components of the lemmatisation entry. At the end we show you how
to deal with compound orthographic forms (crasis and logograms which straightforwardly resolve into two or more Akadian words), phrasal semanitic units (multi-word idioms), and proper
nouns.</p>

<esp:h>Transliteration Stylesheet</esp:h>
<p>Unless your project is primarily working with legacy data, you should follow the <esp:link page="akkstyle">Oracc stylesheet for Akkadian transliteration</esp:link>. This will save you a lot of work by enabling your project to use a related, more mature project's glossaries as the starting point for your lemmatisation, such as <esp:link url="http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/cams/gkab/">CAMS</esp:link>. But this will only work optimally if you use these same spelling and ATF formatting conventions. </p>

<esp:h>Good work habits</esp:h>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Run the checker and lemmatiser every line or so, for maximum
efficiency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you have finished editing a text, run the Harvest Notices
tool on the ATF menu. This will list all the long-form
lemmatisations you have added, enabling you to check them
again.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Check automatically entered lemmatisations for:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>correct normalisation;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>correct sense.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you need to change either of them, use the long form of
lemmatisation.</p>
<p>Sometimes the lemmatiser will make several suggestions for alternative lemmatisations, like this: <code>pān[front]N|immar[see]V|innamir[appear]V|igi[reciprocal]N</code> for the transliteration <code>IGI</code>. Just delete all but the relevant lemmatisation (making sure you delete all the <code>|</code>'s too).</p>

<p>When adding new lemmatisations check whether the word already
exists in the online glossary for your project:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If it is already in the glossary, with a different spelling or
sense (but check you have not mistyped the transliteration!) use
the same CF and GW in the long form, adding new normalisation and
sense as necessary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If it is not yet in the glossary, add it with the the long form
of lemmatisation.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<esp:h>Citation Forms (CF)</esp:h>
<p>We call the “dialect” of CFs “Conventional Akkadian” (CA)
because it does not consistently represent any actually attested
variety of the language. It is essential to follow the <i>Concise
Dictionary of Akkadian</i> for CFs, even when it differs from CAD. This is important for inter-project
compatibility and the ePAD.</p> 
<p>However, there are some small but
consistent ways in which Conventional Akkadian diverges from CDA's
conventions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There is no mimation in CFs (but of course you can give mimation
in NORM0s).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All verbal adjectives and participles have independent CFs even
if they are not listed separately in CDA.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Conventional Akkadian ignores the parentheses in CDA CFs but
keeps their contents, e.g., CDA <i>a(p)puttum</i> becomes CA
<code>+apputtu[difficult situation]N$</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where CDA has alternatives marked with a slash (/), choose the
first, e.g., CDA <i>anḫullû/u?</i> becomes CA <code>+anhullû[(a
plant?)]N$</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<esp:h>Guide Words (GW) and Senses</esp:h>
<p>Generally, we use the first translation in CDA as the GW. So when there are alternatives separated by commas, we
use the first one, e.g., CDA's <i>adirtu</i>, "fear, apprehension" becomes <code>+adirtu[fear]N</code>.</p> 
<p>Exceptions include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>GWs from volumes of CAD that are more recent than CDA (but the
CDA citation form must still be used).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Two exceptions (simply because they are so deeply embedded in
the glossaries that they are too labour intensive to change now): <code>ālu[city]N</code> not "village"; and
<code>libbu[interior]N</code> not "inner body".</p></li>
<li>
<p>If the lemma is a substantivised adjective and CDA gives an
adjectival translation, e.g. <i>qardu</i> (CDA “valiant”, give a
generalised nominal meaning as GW, e.g., <code>+qardu[valiant
one]N$</code>. If CDA gives a nominal meaning, e.g., “hero”, then use
that one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For uncertain meanings use ? after GW, e.g., <code>+karmittu[butterfly?]N$</code>, but
don't use initial ~ as CDA does.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For generic meanings use parenthesised GWs, e.g. [(a tree)].</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For unknown meanings also use parentheses, e.g. [(meaning
unknown)].</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not use @ to indicate Akkadian in GWs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The GW or sense for all weights and measures is [unit], e.g.,
<code>+biltu[load//unit]N'N$bilat</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a CDA entry has no overall GW, but a different GW for each
numbered part of the entry, use the first as GW and then choose
whichever is most appropriate as the sense.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keep the GW as short as possible, e.g., avoid the definite
article. Don't use "to" in the GWs of verbs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But expand abbreviations, e.g., CDA "s.o." becomes <code>someone</code>, "s.th." becomes <code>something</code>, and "o.s." becomes <code>oneself</code>.</p></li>
<li>
<p>For state verbs use the convention [be(come) something] rather than
[be something], e.g., CDA <i>adāru,</i> “be dark, gloomy” becomes
<code>+adāru[be(come) dark]V$īdur</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want to add a local meaning (sense), follow the GW with
// and then the sense, e.g.
<code>+hiāṭu[supervise//survey]V'V$hīṭma</code>. List a sense only when
there is significant variation from the GW. For a verb with a G
stem GW, list the meaning of another verbal stem as a subsense only
if there is significant variation in meaning, e.g., do not list an
N stem passive meaning as a subsense if it is a simple passive form
of the G stem active GW.</p>
<esp:h>Parts of Speech (POS and EPOS)</esp:h>
<p>Whenever you add a SENSE you also need to specificy a new, locally valid POS for a
word, even if it is the same as that for the GW. We call this an EPOS (Effective Part of Speech) and mark it
immediately after the POS, like this:
<code>+kī[like//when]PRP'SBJ$</code>.</p> 

<p>Here are some useful rules about
POS and EPOS:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Infinitives are nouns. Classify them as V'N, with gerund sense,
e.g., <code>+qabû[say//saying]V'N$</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><esp:link url="http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/saao/knpp/cuneiformrevealed/akkadianlanguage/possessionandexistence/#statives">Statives are a form of verbal adjective.</esp:link> Classify them as AJ
(with no EPOS), e.g., <code>+šaṭru[written]AJ$šaṭirma</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Classify verbal adjectives and participles as AJ (with no EPOS)
when they modify a noun, e.g., <code>+šaṭru[written]AJ$šaṭrūti</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Classify verbal adjectives and participles as N (with no EPOS)
when used as substantives, e.g., e.g., <code>+qardu[valiant
one]N$</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Classify substantives as N when used in stative.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Other important points to note:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><i>šū</i> etc. are IPs not DPs, although they can have a
demonstrative sense.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most of the pronouns can also be used to modify a noun, but
remain pronouns in our conventions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be careful not to mark adjectives as nouns.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Similarly, distinguish nouns from prepositions: in prepositional
phrases such as <i>ina muhhi</i>, <i>muhhu</i> is a noun.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But reanalyse N as PRP (i.e., as N'PRP) when the PRP is omitted
from phrases such as <i>ina mahar</i>. Compare, for instance, <code>ina[in]PRP; mahar[front]N; ili[god]N</code> with <code>mahar[before]'PRP ili[god]N</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can use POS and EPOS in proper nouns too, where appropriate,
e.g., <code>{mul}DA.MU = +Damu[]DN'CN$</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<esp:h>Normalisations (NORM0)</esp:h>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Do not use secondary length. Maintain final vowel length as if
no suffix were present (includes possessive suffixes and -ma).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>-ma is not hyphenated in normalisations, e.g.,
<code>+šaṭru[written]AJ$šaṭirma</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For words with
non-standard morphology, normalise what is written, e.g. tuš-za-zi
= tušzazi not tušzaz. Mark vowel length where appropriate. Don't
try to guess what the scribe “meant” to write.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If in doubt over i/e choose i.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Write the first person gen. possessive suffix as <i>iya,</i> not
<i>ia,</i> e.g., <code>+bēlu[lord]N$bēliya</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For <i>pû</i> "mouth" normalise construct state <i>pî</i> and
suffixed form <i>pîšu</i> etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>* I-w verbs in preterite and precative have long first vowel,
unless shown to be short by syncope, e.g., <i>ūbil</i> but
<i>ubla</i>.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<esp:h>Difficult words</esp:h>
<p>It's not always possible to fully lemmatise every word in a text.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For numbers, only lemmatise writings that start syllabically or
have a phonetic complement (e.g. <code>2{+u} = +šanû[two]NU$</code>;
otherwise leave them as <code>n</code>. Note that the POS for both
cardinal and ordinal numbers is NU.</p></li>
<li><p>If you can identify a word's citation form then you should also try to normalise it too.</p></li>
<li><p>Don't bother trying to lemmatise partially preserved words which you cannot restore, such as <code class="example">tu-ša-[...]</code>. The lemmatiser will class them as unlemmatisable by default; don't try to override this.</p></li>
<li><p>Sometimes, especially in very technical contexts such as mathematical astronomy, the meaning of a logogram is known but its Akkadian reading is not. For instance, BAR (Akkadian reading unknown) can mean "lunar velocity". In such cases the logogram becomes the citation form: <code class="example">+BAR[(lunar velocity)]N$</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>However, if you can identify the word but don't know
what it means, you can lemmatise like this: <code class="example">+šahû[(meaning
unknown)]V$ištahhi</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Sometimes, especially in highly technical contexts, it is desirable to gloss GWs with further explanation. This is done in the context of <esp:link page="projunix">glossary management</esp:link>.</p></li>
</ul>

<esp:h>Marking sentences</esp:h>
<p>Insert <code>+.</code> in the lemmatisation line to mark sentences, not
clauses – that is, wherever you judge the translation needs a full
stop. A good rule of thumb is that <code>+.</code> follows indicative verbs that
lack the <i>-ma</i> suffix. Its primary aim is to allow for
transliteration-translation sentence-alignment in due course. It is
not necessary (or perhaps is pointless to try and add it) in
fragmentary texts. It is preceded and (unless at the end of a line)
followed by white space.</p>

<esp:h>Compound Orthographic Forms (COF)</esp:h>

<p>COFs are forms that are written as one word but in fact should be understood as more than one lemma. Their meanings are transparent and they do not justify a separate entry in the glossary.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Link two crasis words in Akkadian by <code>&amp;</code> (no white space or
semi-colon), e.g., <code>ip-pan = ina[in]PRP&amp;pān[front]N</code>, "in front of".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compound logograms should be treated in the same way: e.g., <code>BAR.RA.NA = +ina[in//on]PRP'PRP$&amp;+ahu[arm//side]N'N$ahišu</code>, "on his side".</p>
</li>
</ul>
<esp:h>Phrasal Semantic Units (PSU)</esp:h>
<p>A PSU is a multi-word idiom, whose meaning cannot be inferred from the lemmatisation of its component parts. Each PSU needs its own, manually entered glossary entry. We try to keep PSUs to a minimum.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If it's written logographically, treat the logogram as a single
word and lemmatise the Akkadian words individually with an ampersand in
between: <code>EME.UR.GI₇ = +lišānu[tongue]N$lišān&amp;+kalbu[dog]N$kalbi</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If it's written two (or more) Akkadian words, transliterate and
lemmatise them separately, as normal words.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Either way, write a comment line underneath: <code># psu: lišān
kalbi [hound's-tongue] N</code> so that it can be added into the
glossary manually. You only need to so this if the PSU or its
spelling is new.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don't use senses in PSUs – they're not needed and can seriously
complicate the process of adding them to the glossaries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some phrases can be idiomatic or non-idiomatic, depending on the context. Use <code>!</code> before the first lemma of a PSU to show that it is NOT a PSU in this instance. For instance, if <code>ana[to]PRP;
ṭarsi[extent]N</code> is in your glossary with the meaning "opposite", write <code>!ana[to]PRP;
ṭarsi[extent]N</code> when you want this phrase to keep its literal meaning, "to an extent".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use - before a lemma to omit a word (usually a MOD or AV) from
the middle of a PSU, e.g., <code>libbašu[interior]N; -ul[not]MOD;
iṭâb[be(come) good]V</code> for <code>libba ṭiābu [be(come) satisfied]
V</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Specify the sense of an idiom, in the GW of the first Akkadian
element, like this: <code>ŠA₃.HUL = +lumnu[evil+=eclipsed
state]N$lumun&amp;+libbu[interior]N$libbi,</code> where <i>lumun
libbi</i> has the GW “sorrow” but in some (mostly astronomical)
contexts means “eclipsed state”.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can use PSUs for proper nouns too. However, as we have said, it's a good idea to keep their use to a minimum, as
they are fiddly to implement.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<esp:h>Proper Nouns</esp:h>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In lemmatisation and translation proper nouns have an initial
capital (also for any internal instance of a proper noun) and are
hyphenated at any internal word boundary, e.g., <code>ri-hat-{d}60 =
+Rihat-Anu[]PN$</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The CF used in lemmatisation and the form used in translation
should match. If you want to use a modern equivalent in the
translation, this should be your GW, e.g.,
<code>+Purattu[Euphrates]WN</code>$.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In lemmatisation and translation, DO NOT mark long vowels in
proper nouns.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the writing of a proper noun displays a case ending, then in
lemmatisation give the appropriate declined form as the NORM0.
Otherwise don't try to guess the NORM0, and leave it to match the
CF. Note that Anu(m) is not declined: several instances of the
writing {d}a-nu-um follow <i>ša</i>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In lemmatisation and translation of Sumerian names, use single
rather than reduplicated consonants, e.g., Ezida not Ezidda.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use divine numbers in transliteration and the name in
lemmatisation and translation, e.g., <code>ri-hat-{d}60 =
+Rihat-Anu[]PN$</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a god is an 'anthropomorphic' being, heavenly body, or
mythical location, lemmatise as DN (or DN'GN if appropriate, e.g.,
Apsu) with CF in the absolute state if used, e.g., <code>+Nisaba[]DN$;
+Bel[]DN$</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Otherwise, even if written with {d}, lemmatise as a common noun
with CF in the nominative singular if used, e.g.,
<code>nissabu[grain]N; bēlu[lord]N</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>See the page on <esp:link page="qpn-anno">Linguistic Annotation of Proper Nouns</esp:link> for more information.</p>

<esp:h>Roots</esp:h>
<p>If you want to assign <esp:link page="akk-roots">roots</esp:link> to Akkadian content words (nouns, adjectives, verbs and adverbs), you must do this in your project's Akkadian glossary (the <code>akk.glo</code> file). See the <esp:link page="projemacs" bookmark="h_adding linguisticannotationstotheglossary">Projects and Emacs</esp:link> page for more information.</p>

<p>There is a list of Akkadian roots on a <esp:link page="akk-roots">separate page</esp:link>.</p>

<esp:h>Dialects</esp:h>
<p>You must always explicitly mark the dialects of Akkadian used in your texts. You may also wish to use dialect forms as the headwords of your glossary.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>For texts that are entirely in a single dialect, add that information to the language declaration protocol at the top of the file. For instance, for a Neo-Assyrian text you would type:</p>
<pre class="example">#atf: lang akk-x-neoass</pre>
<p>The dialect codes are given in the <esp:link page="gdltut" bookmark="h_languages">Languages section of the GDL tutorial</esp:link>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>You can mark dialect-switching in the middle of a text too (as, for instance, when Neo-Assrian letter writers quote Standard Babylonian works). To do this, write the short, inline form of the dialect code in the transliteration line before each dialect-switch. Almost all of them are self-explanatory: <code class="cookbook">%na</code> for Neo-Assyrian, <code class="cookbook">%ob</code> for Old Babylonian; they are all listed in the <esp:link page="gdltut" bookmark="h_languages">Languages section of the GDL tutorial</esp:link>.</p>  

<p>For instance, here a scholar quotes a two-line omen in Standard Babylonian (<code class="cookbook">%sb</code>), then comments on it in Neo-Assyrian )<code class="cookbook">%na</code>) with an occasional Neo-Babylonian (<code class="cookbook">%nb</code>) word:</p>
