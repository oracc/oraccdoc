<esp:title>Annotation of Sumerian syntax</esp:title>
<html><head/><body>

<p class="firstpara">This document provides an overview of
  language-specific annotation conventions for Sumerian syntax used in
  Oracc.</p>

<p>There is also a <esp:link page="sux-primer">primer</esp:link> on linguistic annotation of Sumerian, which you should read before this page.</p>

<esp:h>Syntax</esp:h>

<esp:sh>PPCS</esp:sh>

<p>The syntax annotation conventions are developed and maintained in
and adjunct project related to the Pennsylvania Sumerian Dictionary.
This project is known as the PPCS: the Penn Parsed Corpus of
Sumerian.  Its documentation (which is in the process of being
updated) is available on <esp:link url="http://psd.museum.upenn.edu/ppcs/">the
PPCS website</esp:link>.</p>

<p>The PPCS is based on a Penn tradition of parsed corpora which have
common vocabulary and annotation conventions and this has informed the
descriptive vocabulary used for syntactic features.  Readers
interested in the broader context of this work can see the <esp:link url="http://www.ling.upenn.edu/hist-corpora/">Penn Parsed Corpora of
Historical English Home Page</esp:link>.</p>

<esp:sh>Parser</esp:sh>

<p>Syntax processing is carried out using a Sumerian-specific parser
which understands enough about Sumerian syntax to enable it to work
effectively on many texts with only minimal hints being given in the
annotation.  In the following sections we describe what the parser can
and cannot do, and what it sometimes needs to be prevented from doing,
at the same time as we describe the notations and features relevant to
annotation in ATF files.</p>

<esp:sh>Phrasal Parenthesis</esp:sh>

<p>Parenthetic noun-phrases (NP-PRN) are the name used for
appositional phrases.  The parser normally recognizes parenthetic phrases
automatically by considering the context and the semantic class of key
words.</p>

<p>To force a lemma to be the head noun of a parenthetic phrase, use
the notation <code class="cookbook">+,</code> (plus-sign followed by
comma).  To suppress parenthetic interpretation, use <code class="cookbook">-,</code> (minus-sign followed by comma).</p>

<p>In the following example, the parser defaults to understanding
<code>dijir</code> as parenthetic but that is incorrect; the
annotation suppresses the parser's enthusiasm in this case:</p>

<pre class="cookbook">
1. {d}nin-jesz-zid-da
#lem: DN

2. dijir gu3-de2-a-kam
#lem: -, dijir[deity]; RN
</pre>

<esp:sh>Phrasal Conjunction</esp:sh>

<p>Because the parser defaults to understanding adjacent otherwise
unmarked NPs as parenthetic it is necessary to mark phrasal
conjunctions unless they are in the parser's built-in table.</p>

<p>The following entries are in the parser's table:</p>

<pre class="example">
# List of N N conjunction pairs
# input must be a list of pairs of ePSD CFGWs
an[heaven] ki[earth]
dam[spouse] dumu[child]
kug[metal] zagin[lapis lazuli]
gud[ox] udu[sheep]
kugsig[gold] kugbabbar[silver]
Enki Ninki
</pre>

<p>Common cases should be added to this list; less common cases can be
annotated using the convention <code class="cookbook">+&amp;</code>
(plus-sign ampersand). Similarly, an unwanted conjunction can be suppressed using the
notation <code class="cookbook">-&amp;</code> (minus-sign
ampersand):</p>

<pre class="cookbook">
1. ku6 muszen
#lem: kud[fish]; +&amp; muszen[bird]
</pre>

<esp:sh>Noun-noun Modification</esp:sh>

<p>Nouns can modify nouns in Sumerian and the parser supports this
with a built-in table (derived mainly from third millennium royal
inscriptions) as well as the notation <code class="cookbook">+&lt;</code>.  The current version of the table contains
the following entries:</p>

<pre class="example">
# List of N N modifier pairs; default is to assume post-mod
# for pre-mod put '+' before first element
#
# input must be a list of pairs of ePSD CFGWs; proper nouns should
# not have a guideword element

e[house] ub[corner]

šita[weapon] saŋ[head]
šita[weapon] ur[lion]
ur[lion] saŋ[head]

aga[rear] eren[cedar]

eš[shrine] Bagara
eš[shrine] Gutur
eš[shrine] Nibru
eš[shrine] Ŋirsu
gu[neck] Idigna
iri[city] Ŋirsu
egal[palace] Tiraš
hursaŋ[mountain] Uringiriaz
hursaŋ[mountain] Magan
kur[foreign land] Magan
kur[foreign land] Dilmun
abulla[gate] Kasurra

i[oil] nun[prince]
ir[scent] nun[prince]

mu[name] gilsa[treasure]

kar[harbor] zagin[lapis lazuli]
udu[sheep] i[oil]
udu[sheep] nita[male]
gur[unit] lugal[king]
</pre>

<p>A manually annoted N-N modifier looks like this:</p>

<pre class="cookbook">
1. ab2 ti dara4
#lem: ab[cow]; +&lt; ti[rib]; dara[brown]
#tr: brown-ribbed cow
</pre>

<esp:sh>Pre-modification</esp:sh>

<p>Premodification, with the exception of kug inana, must be annotated
manually using the notation <code class="example">+&gt;</code>:</p>

<pre class="cookbook">
1. kug ama {d}nansze
#lem: kug[pure] +&gt; ; ama[mother]; DN
</pre>

<esp:sh>Subordinate Clauses</esp:sh>

<p>Annotation of subordinate clauses generally involves only giving
the start of the clause using the <code class="example">([WORD])</code> convention.  Notes on individual
clause types are given below.</p>

<esp:sh>Relative Clauses</esp:sh>

<p>The parser is usually able to determine the start of a relative
clause. If necessary, however, the notation <code class="cookbook">(S-REL)</code> can be inserted before the first lemma
of the clause:</p>

<pre class="cookbook">
1. lu2 e2 mu-du3-a
#lem: lu[person]; (S-REL) e[house]; du[build]
</pre>

<p><strong>N.B.:</strong>This is just by way of example; relatives
like this are correctly handled by the parser without hinting.</p>

<esp:sh>DE3 Clauses</esp:sh>

<p>The parser never tries to guess the start of a DE3-clause.  As a
result, it is always necessary to supply the start and type of the
clause.  The most common type is purpose (S-PRP); other DE3-clauses
should be tagged as S-ADV:</p>

<pre class="cookbook">
1. e2 du3-u3-de3 i3-jen
#lem: (S-PRP) e[house]; du[build]; jen[go]
</pre>
